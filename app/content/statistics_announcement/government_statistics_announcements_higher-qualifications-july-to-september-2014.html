  This bulletin covers qualifications of all types at Level 4 and above (equivalent to post-A level), excluding university degrees, which are regulated by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) rather than Ofqual. There is some overlap between the figures in this bulletin and the Vocational Qualifications Quarterly which covers NVQ, VRQ, QCF and Occupational Qualifications at all levels. Produced using data submitted by awardingÂ organisations.
