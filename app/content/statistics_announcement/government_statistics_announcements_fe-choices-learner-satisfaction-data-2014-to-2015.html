 <p class="description">
  The publication of the FE Choices Learner Satisfaction data takes place annually after the results of the Learner Satisfaction survey are collated and calculated. The survey captures learners’ experiences of their college or training organisation through a series of questions. The Learner Satisfaction Survey performance indicator score is calculated for each eligible college or training organisation. This enables comparisons to be made against other college or training organisations of the same organisation type and also allows comparisons against any college or training organisations for which a score has been calculated.
