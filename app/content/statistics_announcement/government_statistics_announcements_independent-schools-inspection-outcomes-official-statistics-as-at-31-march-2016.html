  <h2>
   Statistics release cancelled
  </h2>
  <p>
   Publication of the Non-association independent schools inspection outcomes statistical release will not be possible until December 2016. The introduction of a new operating system in Ofsted to manage and store inspection data required the development of a new data warehouse and the redevelopment of all reporting tools.  Issues with the transition to the new system and development of new reporting tools have impacted on the quality of data and timing of some publications. Prioritisation of the release of data has been guided by user needs.  
The December 2016 release of Non-association independent schools inspection outcomes official statistics will contain the  September 2015 – 31 March 2016 data.
