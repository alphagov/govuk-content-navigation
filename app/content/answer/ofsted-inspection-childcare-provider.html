     You could be inspected at any time if you’re only on the Childcare Register.

     You’ll get a letter telling you’ve met the requirements or not.

    <h2>
     Early Years Register
    </h2>
    <p>
     If you’re on the Early Years Register, you’ll usually be inspected within the first 30 months of
     <a href="/register-childminder-childcare-provider">
      registration
     </a>
     and then at least once in every inspection cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
     The current Early Years inspection cycle finishes on 31 July 2016.
    </p>
    <p>
     You’ll also be inspected if someone reports concerns about the childcare you’re providing.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Getting notice of an inspection
    </h3>
    <p>
     Nurseries and pre-schools will get a call on or after midday on the working day before the start of the inspection. 
You’ll still be inspected even if the inspector hasn’t been able to speak to anyone at the nursery or pre-school.
    </p>
    <p>
     Childminders or providers that don’t operate regularly will get a call up to 5 days before an inspection to check what days they work and if there will be children present. You’ll be told what time the inspection will start but not what day it will start.
    </p>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      You can be inspected without warning. This is normally if Ofsted are concerned about the childcare you provide.
     </p>
    </div>
    <p>
     If you’re a home childcarer, Ofsted will ask the occupier of the home where you work for permission to carry out the inspection.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Before the inspection visit
    </h3>
    <p>
     You must tell parents an inspection is going to take place.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can do a
     <a href="https://online.ofsted.gov.uk/onlineofsted/Default.aspx" rel="external">
      self evaluation online
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <h3>
     During the inspection visit
    </h3>
    <p>
     To find out about the quality of teaching and learning you provide, the inspector will:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      observe the children at play
     </li>
     <li>
      talk to you and the children
     </li>
     <li>
      observe how you and the children interact
     </li>
     <li>
      check the children’s levels of understanding and if they take part in learning
     </li>
     <li>
      talk to you about the children’s knowledge, skills and abilities
     </li>
     <li>
      observe care routines and how they’re used to support children’s personal development
     </li>
     <li>
      evaluate your knowledge of the early years curriculum
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The inspector will give you feedback and explain what needs to be done to improve, if necessary.
    </p>
    <h3>
     After the inspection visit
    </h3>
    <p>
     You’ll be sent a report with your grade. You’ll be told how to do better, if there’s anything that can be improved.
    </p>
    <p>
     You’ll be graded as one of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Grade 1 - outstanding
     </li>
     <li>
      Grade 2 - good
     </li>
     <li>
      Grade 3 - requires improvement
     </li>
     <li>
      Grade 4 - inadequate
     </li>
    </ul>

     </a>
     to find out what these grades mean.
    </p>
    <p>
     Your inspection report will be
     <a href="/find-ofsted-inspection-report">
      published online
     </a>
     within 10 working days of you being sent it.
    </p>
    <p>
     You must give a copy of the report to the parents of the children you look after and to anyone else who asks for one, unless you applied to register voluntarily.
    </p>
    <h3>
     If your judgement is ‘outstanding’
    </h3>
    <p>
     You can use the Ofsted outstanding provider logo on your stationery and website.
    </p>
    <h3>
     If your judgement is ‘inadequate’
    </h3>
    <p>
     You’ll be inspected again within 6 months.
    </p>
    <p>
     You’ll be told what you must do to remain registered, and the date by which it must be done. Your local authority will also be informed, which may affect your eligibility for funding.
    </p>
    <h3>
     If you’re judged as ‘inadequate with enforcement’
    </h3>
    <p>
     You’ll be monitored by an inspector. They’ll visit you to check how you’re progressing against the areas you were told needed improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ofsted may take further action if there’s no improvement. If you have 2 inspections in a row where you’re  judged as inadequate, Ofsted can cancel your registration.
