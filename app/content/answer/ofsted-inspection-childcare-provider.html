     You’ll be inspected by Ofsted when you’re
     <a href="/register-childminder-childcare-provider">
      registered as a childminder or childcare provider
     </a>
     . This is to make sure you’re meeting the requirements for safety and learning and development.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you don’t meet the requirements, you’ll be told what you need to do to improve and when you need to improve by.
    </p>
    <p>
     When you’ll be inspected depends on which register you’re on.

    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      If you’re on the Childcare Register and the Early Years Register, you’ll be inspected for both at the same time.

     You could be inspected at any time if you’re only on the Childcare Register.

    <p>
     You’ll get a letter to tell you whether you’ve met the requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
     The inspection result will be

    <p>
     If you’re on the Early Years Register, you’ll usually be inspected within the first 30 months of
     <a href="/register-childminder-childcare-provider">
      registration
     </a>
     and then at least once in every inspection cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
     You’ll also be inspected if someone reports concerns about the childcare you’re providing.

     Getting notice of an inspection
    </h3>
    <p>
     If you’re an organisation (like a nursery or pre-school), you’ll get a call on or after midday on the working day before the start of the inspection. You’ll still be inspected even if the inspector hasn’t been able to speak to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Childminders or providers that don’t operate regularly will get a call up to 5 days before an inspection to check what days they work. You’ll be told what time the inspection will start but not what day it will start.
    </p>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      You can be inspected without warning. This is normally if Ofsted are concerned about the childcare you provide.
     </p>
    </div>
    <p>
     If you’re a home childcarer, Ofsted will ask the occupier of the home where you work for permission to carry out the inspection.
