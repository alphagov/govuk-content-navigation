  <p>You can complain about an Ofsted inspection report if you’re a school, childcare provider or other institution inspected by Ofsted and you think there was a problem with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the inspection process</li>
  <li>how the inspection was conducted, eg the behaviour of an inspector</li>
  <li>the outcome of the inspection, including the report</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re a parent or member of the public, contact the school or provider with your concerns about an inspection. You can’t complain to Ofsted directly.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Ofsted is unlikely to stop the publication of a report or remove an existing one while a complaint is being investigated.</p>
</div>

<h2>Before you complain</h2>

<p>You should raise any concerns during the inspection by speaking to the lead inspector.</p>

<p>Call the Ofsted helpline if you can’t speak to the lead inspector - ask for a senior manager from Ofsted or the company coordinating the inspection.</p>

<p>Concerns can often be addressed before the report is drafted or published.</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong>Ofsted helpline</strong><br>
Telephone: 0300 123 1231<br>
Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm<br>

<h2>How to complain</h2>

<p>You must <a href="/government/organisations/ofsted/about/complaints-procedure">complain online</a> if your concerns were not resolved during the inspection.</p>

<p>You can complain at any time up to 10 working days:</p>

<ul>
  <li>after the concern was raised</li>
  <li>after the report has been published</li>
</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Read about how Ofsted <a href="/government/publications/complaints-about-ofsted">handles complaints</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>What happens next</h2>

<p>An investigating officer will contact you to discuss the complaint. They’ll investigate using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence from the report</li>
  <li>feedback from the team that carried out your inspection</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll get a written response, normally within 30 working days of Ofsted getting your complaint.</p>

<h2>Ask for an ‘internal review’</h2>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://contact.ofsted.gov.uk/onlinecomplaintsreview">ask Ofsted to review your complaint again</a> (known as an internal review) if you’re not happy with the way it was handled.</p>

<p>You must do this within 15 working days of the date the original response was sent.</p>

<p>A ‘scrutiny committee’ will independently review the handling of your complaint. You should get a final response within 30 working days.</p>

<h2>If you’re still unhappy</h2>

<p>You can ask <a rel="external" href="http://www.ofstedadjudicationservice.co.uk/?p=introduction">Independent Complaints Adjudication Service for Ofsted (<abbr title="Independent Complaints Adjudication Service for Ofsted">ICASO</abbr>)</a> to review the case.</p>

<p>You must do this within 3 months of getting Ofsted’s written response to the internal review.</p>

<p><abbr title="Independent Complaints Adjudication Service for Ofsted">ICASO</abbr> can’t change the outcome of the complaint, but it can make recommendations to Ofsted.</p>

<p>If you’re an individual or a private organisation and you’re unhappy with <abbr title="Independent Complaints Adjudication Service for Ofsted">ICASO</abbr>’s review, you can also complain to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/">Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman</a>. They don’t handle complaints from public organisations, eg state schools.</p>
