    <p>
     The council must:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      give you a personal adviser who stays in touch with you once you’ve left care
     </li>
     <li>
      carry out an assessment to find out what advice and support you need - they must also prepare a plan to make this happen (called a ‘pathway plan’)
     </li>
     <li>
      make sure you’ve got somewhere to live and enough money (until you turn 18)
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="discussing-your-future">
     Discussing your future

     </li>
     <li>
      if you’re going to work, get training or continue in education
     </li>
     <li>

     When you reach 16

     Your personal adviser must take part in any pathway plan reviews until you’re 21, or older if you’re still in education. Your plan must be reviewed:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      every 6 months at least
     </li>
     <li>
      if you ask for one
