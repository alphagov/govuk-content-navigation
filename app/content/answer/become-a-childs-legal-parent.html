      You’ll need to apply for a parental order when you and your partner use a surrogate to have a child.
     </p>
    </div>
    <p>
     Getting a parental order transfers legal rights from the birth mother to you and your partner when a surrogate is used to have a child.

     Parental orders

    <p>
     You must be genetically related to a child to apply for a parental order, ie the egg or sperm donor, and in a relationship where you and your partner are either:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      married
     </li>
     <li>
      civil partners
     </li>
     <li>
      living as partners
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     You and your partner must also:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      have the child living with you
     </li>
     <li>
      reside permanently in either the UK, Channel Islands or Isle of Man
     </li>
    </ul>

     How to apply
    </h2>
    <p>
     You must fill in a
     <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=2397" rel="external">
      ‘C51 application form for a parental order’
     </a>
     and give this to a
     <a href="https://courttribunalfinder.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">
      family proceedings court
     </a>
     within 6 months of the child’s birth.
    </p>
    <p>
     You’ll need to provide the child’s full birth certificate and will also be charged a court fee of £215.
    </p>
    <p>
     The court will then set a date for the hearing and issue you with a ‘C52 acknowledgement form’ that you must give to the child’s legal parent, ie your surrogate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The birth mother and anyone else who’s a parent of the child must agree to the parental order
     <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=2396" rel="external">
      in writing.
     </a>
    </p>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      You can’t apply for a parental order once the child is older than 6 months.
