    <h2>
     Areas of learning
    </h2>
    <p>
     Your child will mostly be taught through games and play.
    </p>
    <p>
     The areas of learning are:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      communication and language
     </li>
     <li>
      physical development
     </li>
     <li>
      personal, social and emotional development
     </li>
     <li>
      literacy
     </li>
     <li>
      mathematics
     </li>
     <li>
      understanding the world
     </li>
     <li>
      expressive arts and design
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
     Assessments
    </h2>
    <p>
     Your child’s progress will be reviewed when they’re between 2 and 3 by an early years practitioner or health visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their class teacher will assess them at the end of the school year when they turn 5.
    </p>
    <p>
     The assessment is based on classroom observation - your child won’t be tested. It uses the early learning goals, which can be found in the
     <a href="/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2">
      early years framework
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <h2>
     If an area of learning conflicts with your beliefs
    </h2>
    <p>
     Talk to your child’s early years provider if you think one or more areas of the
     <abbr title="Early years foundation stage">
      EYFS
     </abbr>
     conflict with your religious or philosophical beliefs. They’ll tell you if you need to ask for an ‘exemption’.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you get an exemption, your child won’t have to take part in a specific area of learning for 12 months.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Ask for an exemption
    </h3>
    <p>
     Write to your early years provider if you decide to ask for an exemption. You must explain how your religious or philosophical beliefs conflict with:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      an area of learning
     </li>
     <li>
      a learning goal or assessment
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Your early years provider will decide if you can get an exemption. If you get one, you’ll need to apply again after 12 months.
