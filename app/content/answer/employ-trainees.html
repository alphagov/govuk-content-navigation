     Pay and conditions

    <p>
     You don’t have to pay trainees or give them expenses, but you can if you want to.
    </p>
    <p>
     You and your training organisation decide:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      what days and times the trainee will come to you for work experience
     </li>
     <li>
      what they’ll do
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     You must give constructive feedback and advice during the placement.
    </p>
    <p>
     You should give the trainee a job or exit interview and formal feedback at the end of the placement.
