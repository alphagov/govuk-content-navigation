      You might be able to stop a child or vulnerable person getting a passport.
     </p>
    </div>
    <p>
     You may want to do this if:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      you think your child may be abducted and taken overseas by their other parent (or someone who has
      <a href="/parental-rights-responsibilities/who-has-parental-responsibility">
       parental responsibility
      </a>
      )
     </li>
     <li>
      a relative is vulnerable (eg has a mental disability) and you don’t think it would be safe for them to have a passport
     </li>
    </ul>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      Contact the police or social services if you’re concerned about these issues.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div aria-label="Help" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      You shouldn’t stop a child’s passport if they’ve already been taken overseas. It makes the process of getting them back harder and may also be against the law.
