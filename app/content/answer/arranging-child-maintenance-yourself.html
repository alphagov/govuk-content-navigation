      You can arrange child maintenance yourself if both parents agree.
     </p>
    </div>
    <p>
     A ‘family-based arrangement’ is a private way to sort out child maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Parents arrange everything themselves and no one else has to be involved. It’s flexible and can be changed if circumstances change.
    </p>
    <p>
     You agree how much the payments should be and when they should be made. There’s no official paperwork but you can write down your agreement in case of future disagreement.
    </p>
    <p>
     For example, you could both agree that the paying parent pays:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      a proportion of their income
     </li>
     <li>
      for things like school clothes instead of giving money
     </li>
     <li>
      a regular set amount directly to the parent with care
     </li>
    </ul>

     Family-based arrangements aren’t legally binding. Child Maintenance Options has information about asking a court to

      formalise your agreement
     </a>

     You might be able to

      use the Child Maintenance Service
     </a>
     to make a new formal arrangement instead. This is called a ‘statutory arrangement’.
    </p>
    <p>
     You must contact Child Maintenance Options first.
