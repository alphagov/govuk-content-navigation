     Even though you’ve stopped work to have a baby you’re entitled to get Working Tax Credit for:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      the first 39 weeks of maternity (or adoption) leave
     </li>
     <li>
      your period of ordinary paternity leave
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     To qualify, you must have been working at least 16 or 30 hours a week before your leave. The actual
     <a href="/working-tax-credit/eligibility">
      number of hours
     </a>
     depends on your circumstances.

     How to claim
    </h2>
    <p>
     You can:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      apply for
      <a href="/claim-tax-credits">
       tax credits
      </a>
      - if you’ve not applied for tax credits before
     </li>
     <li>
      update your claim - if you’ve already applied for Child or Working Tax Credit
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     To update a claim, just
     <a href="/contact/hm-revenue-customs/tax-credits-enquiries">
      contact the Tax Credit Office
     </a>
     - you don’t need to fill out a claim form.
    </p>
    <h3 id="when-to-claim">
     When to claim
    </h3>
    <p>
     Tell the Tax Credit Office within 1 month of the birth so your claim can be backdated to the date of birth.  If you don’t, your tax credits will only be backdated by 1 month from the date of your claim.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
     <p>
      <strong>
       Example
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Your baby is born 1 September.
     </p>
     <p>
      You tell the Tax Credit Office on 1 January so your tax credits get backdated to 1 December.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you’d told them by 1 October you’d be getting tax credits from 1 September.
