      Child Benefit is usually paid every 4 weeks on a Monday or Tuesday.
     </p>
    </div>
    <p>
     Your next payment will usually be 4 weeks after your last payment - or early if it’s a bank holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can get Child Benefit paid weekly if you’re a single parent or if you or your partner are getting certain other benefits, such as Income Support.
    </p>
    <p>
     Your award notice tells you the date of your first payment. It can take up to 12 weeks to process a new Child Benefit claim (or longer if you’re new to the UK).

     Your payments may have stopped because:

      you haven’t told the Child Benefit  Office your bank has changed or your child’s education plans after they turn 16
