     When schools are responsible for health and safety
    </h2>
    <p>
     Schools are responsible for day-to-day health and safety whenever your child is in the care of school staff - this includes school trips and clubs.

    <h2 id="what-schools-are-responsible-for">
     What schools are responsible for
    </h2>
    <p>
     Every school has a health and safety policy. Ask the school if you want to read it. It should contain details of what the school is responsible for (eg school trips) as well as what they should do to look after your child.
    </p>
    <p>
     Schools must follow the same
     <a href="/workplace-temperatures">
      health and safety law for indoor temperature
     </a>
     as other workplaces.
    </p>
    <h3 id="class-sizes">
     Class sizes
    </h3>
    <p>
     There’s no legal limit to class size for health and safety reasons. To help raise standards in maintained schools, children between 5 and 7 have a maximum class size of 30.
