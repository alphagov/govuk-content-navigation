      Surrogates are the legal mother of any child they carry, unless they sign a parental order after they give birth transferring their rights to the intended parents.

    </div>
    <h2 id="mothers-rights">
     Mother’s rights
    </h2>
    <p>
     The woman who gives birth is always treated as the legal mother and has the right to keep the child - even if they’re not genetically related.
    </p>
    <p>
     Surrogacy contracts aren’t enforced by UK law, even if a contract has been signed with the intended parents and they’ve paid for any expenses.
    </p>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      It’s illegal to pay a surrogate in the UK, except for their reasonable expenses.

     Father’s rights

    <p>
     The child’s legal father or ‘second parent’ is the surrogate’s husband or civil partner unless:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      legal rights are given to someone else through a
      <a href="/become-a-childs-legal-parent" title="Become a child's legal parent">
       parental order
      </a>
      or
      <a href="/child-adoption/overview" title="Child adoption">
       adoption
      </a>
     </li>
     <li>
      the surrogate’s husband or civil partner didn’t give their permission to their wife or partner
     </li>
    </ul>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      If a surrogate has no partner, or they’re unmarried and not in a civil partnership, the child will have no legal father or second parent unless the partner actively consents.

     Maternity leave

    <p>
     Every pregnant employee has the right to 52 weeks’

      maternity leave
     </a>
     and to return to their job after this.
    </p>
    <p>
     What a birth mother does after the child is born has no impact on her right to maternity leave.
