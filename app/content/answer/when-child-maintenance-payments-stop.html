      Child maintenance payments usually stop when the child reaches 16 (or 20 if they’re in
      <a href="/child-benefit-16-19">
       full-time education
      </a>
      up to A-level or equivalent).
     </p>
    </div>
    <p>
     Child maintenance can also stop if, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      the child stops being eligible for Child Benefit
     </li>
     <li>
      the parent being paid stops being the child’s main carer
     </li>
     <li>
      the parent being paid doesn’t want it any more
     </li>
     <li>
      either parent dies
     </li>
     <li>
      the paying parent is eligible for the ‘
      <a href="/how-child-maintenance-is-worked-out/rates-used-by-the-child-support-agency">
       nil rate
      </a>
      ’, eg because they’re a student or a prisoner
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     If the paying parent stops being eligible for the ‘nil rate’, payments start again automatically. The receiving parent doesn’t need to re-apply for child maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
     When child maintenance stops any unpaid amounts up to that point must still be paid. These are known as ‘arrears’.
