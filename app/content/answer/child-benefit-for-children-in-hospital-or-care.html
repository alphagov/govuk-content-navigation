     Your Child Benefit payments might be affected if your child goes into:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      care for more than 8 weeks
     </li>
     <li>
      hospital or ‘residential care’ for more than 12 weeks
     </li>
    </ul>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      Residential care is accommodation paid for by your local council, usually because your child has a mental or physical disability. It’s different from ‘care’.
     </p>
    </div>
    <p>
     The hospital can be abroad if the child’s spending less than a year abroad.

     You should tell the Child Benefit Office if this happens. You can do this:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <a href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=%2Fforms%2Fform%2Fchild-benefit-child-change-of-circumstances%2Fnew&amp;accountType=individual" rel="external">

     </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="breaks-in-hospital-or-residential-care">
     Breaks in hospital or residential care
    </h2>
    <p>
     If the child goes back into hospital or residential care within 28 days of leaving it - the total time spent away from home will count towards the 12 week (84 day) limit.
    </p>
    <h2 id="after-8-or-12-weeks">
     After 8 or 12 weeks
    </h2>
    <p>
     Usually, you’re no longer entitled to Child Benefit after the time limit. There are exceptions to this rule, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      for children in care - if they spend at least 24 hours a week at home
     </li>
     <li>
      for children in a UK hospital or residential care - if you regularly spend money on them
     </li>
     <li>
      for children in hospital abroad - if you’re back in the UK and regularly spending money on them
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Your partner’s money will only count if you’re married or civil partnered and living together.
    </p>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      Check with the Child Benefit Office to find out if exceptions apply to you.
     </p>
    </div>
    <p>
     You may be able to claim Child Benefit again if the child is in care but spends 2 nights in a row each week or 7 days or more in a row at home.
