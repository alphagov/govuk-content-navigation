     You can get support and financial help if someone else’s child is living with you full time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Your arrangement may be known as either:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      family and friends care (often called kinship care)
     </li>
     <li>
      private fostering
     </li>

    <h2 id="family-and-friends-carers">
     Family and friends carers
    </h2>
    <p>
     You’re known as a family and friends carer if you’re a grandparent, aunt, uncle, brother, sister or family friend looking after a child who can’t be cared for by their birth parents.
    </p>
    <p>
     You must be approved as a foster carer if the local council has officially asked you to look after a child.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the local council didn’t ask you to look after the child you don’t have to tell them the child has come to stay with you.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you’re a grandparent giving full-time care to grandchildren, you can get information from:
