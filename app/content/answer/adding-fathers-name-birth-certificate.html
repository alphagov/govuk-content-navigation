     Re-register your child’s birth to add the natural father’s details to the birth record.
    </p>
    <p>
     The form you fill in depends on whether:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <a href="/government/publications/application-to-re-register-a-childs-birth-following-marriage-of-natural-parents">
       you marry the natural father after your child’s birth was registered
      </a>
      - you must re-register the birth by law
     </li>
     <li>
      you’re not married but
      <a href="/government/publications/application-to-re-register-a-childs-birth-and-add-the-natural-fathers-details">
       you want the natural father’s name on the birth record
      </a>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Take the completed form to the
     <a href="/register-offices">
      register office
     </a>
     . If you’re not married and one of you can’t be there, that person also needs to fill in a
     <a href="/government/publications/statutory-declaration-of-acknowledgement-of-parentage-form">
      ‘Statutory declaration of acknowledgement of parentage
     </a>
     ’ form and post it to the
     <a href="/general-register-office">
      General Register Office
     </a>
     .

    <h2 id="getting-a-new-birth-certificate">
     Getting a new birth certificate
    </h2>
    <p>
     If you want a new birth certificate you’ll have to
     <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate">
      order one
     </a>
     separately - you don’t get one automatically when you re-register the birth.
    </p>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      If the wrong father is named on the current birth certificate, you can
      <a href="/correct-birth-registration">
       ask for a correction
      </a>
      . That will remove the wrong father’s name. Then you can re-register the birth with the right father’s name.
     </p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="if-theres-been-a-declaration-of-parentage">
     If there’s been a ‘Declaration of Parentage’
    </h2>
    <p>
     A Declaration of Parentage is when the court decides who the father of a baby is. You don’t need to do anything to change the birth record if there’s been a Declaration of Parentage made by a court. The court will tell the General Register Office and the birth will be re-registered. You’ll need to order a new birth certificate if you want one.
