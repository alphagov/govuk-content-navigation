      <abbr title="European Economic Area">
       EEA
      </abbr>
     </a>
     or Switzerland. You must pay National Insurance in the UK (ie you’re employed or self-employed) or get 1 of the following benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Contribution-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
     </li>
     <li>
      Incapacity Benefit
     </li>
     <li>
      Contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance
     </li>
     <li>
      State Pension

      Bereavement Allowance (Widow’s Pension)
     </li>
     <li>
      Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     If you and your partner live in different countries you may qualify for Child Benefit or its equivalent in both. The country the child lives in will usually pay the benefit. If the benefit is more in the other country, that country will pay you extra.
