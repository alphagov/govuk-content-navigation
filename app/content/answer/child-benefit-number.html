      You can normally use your Child Benefit number to prove you qualify for Child Benefit. Check with whoever is asking what proof they need and how up to date it has to be.

     You may be able to use the following if you need more than your Child Benefit number:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Child Benefit award notice
     </li>
     <li>
      latest Tax Credits award notice
     </li>
     <li>
      a bank statement showing Child Benefit going into your account
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     You can’t get written proof of Child Benefit from the Child Benefit Office.

     Your Child Benefit number starts with ‘CHB’ and is made up of 8 numbers and 2 letters, eg CHB12345678 AB.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s on your Child Benefit award notice and usually on paperwork from the Child Benefit Office.
    </p>

     You can also contact the Child Benefit Office
