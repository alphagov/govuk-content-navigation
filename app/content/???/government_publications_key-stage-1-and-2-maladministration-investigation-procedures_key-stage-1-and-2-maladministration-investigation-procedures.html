      This page outlines the Standards and Testing Agency’s (
      <abbr title="Standards and Testing Agency">
       STA
      </abbr>
      ) procedures for investigating allegations of maladministration relating to national curriculum assessments.
     </p>
     <p>
      On behalf of the Secretary of State, we have a statutory duty to investigate matters which, in our opinion, relate to the accuracy or correctness of pupils’ results and/or outcomes in the national curriculum assessments. These comprise of:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the phonics screening check
      </li>
      <li>
       the national curriculum tests and teacher assessment in key stage 1 (
       <abbr title="key stage 1">
        KS1
       </abbr>
       ) and key stage 2 (
       <abbr title="key stage 2">
        KS2
       </abbr>
       ).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The aim of these procedures is to safeguard the integrity of the assessments.

      ‘Maladministration’ refers to any act that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       affects the integrity, security or confidentiality of the national curriculum assessments
      </li>
      <li>
       could lead to results and/or outcomes that don’t reflect pupils’ unaided work or actual abilities
      </li>
     </ul>

      Matters reported to us in relation to the accuracy or correctness of pupils’ results in the national curriculum assessments are referred to as ‘allegations of maladministration’ in these procedures.

      Our maladministration team logs allegations of maladministration and then decides on one of the following courses of action.
     </p>
     <h4 id="maladministration-has-not-occurred">
      Maladministration has not occurred
     </h4>
     <p>
      We will close the case and no further action will be taken.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a school is aware that an allegation has been made, our maladministration team will provide written confirmation that no action is to be taken. This will be copied to the
      <abbr title="local authority">
       LA
      </abbr>
      , and the school’s governing body where applicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a school is unaware of the allegation, eg the allegation arose from a marker’s concern, the case will be closed with no further action. The school will not be informed.
     </p>
     <h4 id="maladministration-has-occurred-but-there-is-no-doubt-over-the-accuracy-or-correctness-of-pupils-assessments">
      Maladministration has occurred but there is no doubt over the accuracy or correctness of pupils’ assessments
     </h4>
     <p>
      We may decide that maladministration has occurred but it hasn’t affected the accuracy or correctness of pupils’ results. Where this is the case we won’t change or annul the school’s assessments. We will write to the school informing them of this decision and, where applicable, suggest actions for the school to take to ensure similar maladministration doesn’t occur again. We will copy our decision to the
      <abbr title="local authority">
       LA
      </abbr>
      and the school’s governing body where applicable. We may ask schools to confirm any follow up actions to us and their

      </abbr>
      staff or our maladministration team may visit a school as part of an investigation. We use visits to gather information about:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the procedures in place to keep test and check materials secure
      </li>
      <li>
       how the tests or check were administered
      </li>
      <li>
       the actions the school put in place to ensure their teacher assessment data was correct and accurate
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If the school doesn’t already know the nature of the allegation, they will be informed at the end of the visit. This protects the source of the allegation and ensures that interviewees provide unbiased accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the visit, the lead interviewer will write a report of their findings for our maladministration team. This report becomes
      <abbr title="Standards and Testing Agency">
       STA
      </abbr>
      ’s property. We will give the school a copy of the report, but any personal/identifying information will be redacted. The school will then be given the opportunity to provide a written response to the report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our maladministration team will review the report, any response from the school and any other evidence. We will then decide what further action is necessary. We will inform the school, the
      <abbr title="local authority">
       LA
      </abbr>
      and the school’s governing body (where appropriate) of any developments during the course of the investigation.

      </span>
      How we make decisions
     </h2>
     <p>
      We may take several months to reach a final decision on an investigation. The length of an investigation depends on:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the nature of the allegation
      </li>
      <li>
       the complexity of the case
      </li>
      <li>
       availability of information relevant to a case
      </li>
      <li>
       timing of when the allegation was reported
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      It is important to note we will only consider information from schools that we have received by the deadline given by our maladministration team. We use case decision meetings to make final decisions on what actions are to be taken.  Schools and
      <abbr title="local authorities">
       LAs
      </abbr>
      are not invited to attend these meetings.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the meeting, the investigator presents all information gathered during the investigation to the decision maker (this is either a senior manager or director of
      <abbr title="Standards and Testing Agency">
       STA
      </abbr>
      ). This information may include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       reports and examples of pupils’ work provided by the school
      </li>
      <li>
       the school visit report and the school’s response to this report
      </li>
      <li>
       information from
       <abbr title="key stage 1">
        KS1
       </abbr>
       ,
       <abbr title="key stage 2">
        KS2
       </abbr>
       or phonics screening check monitoring visits
      </li>
      <li>
       outcomes from test script investigations
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The investigator will also make a recommendation for actions to be taken against a school’s results. This could be for whole cohorts, groups of pupils (partial cohorts) or individual pupils.
     </p>
     <p>
      The investigator is not involved in the decision making process. Any decisions to amend, annul or discount pupils’ results and/or assessments are made by senior members of
      <abbr title="Standards and Testing Agency">
       STA
      </abbr>
      staff. Schools will be notified of the outcome of the investigation and if this affects their pupils’ results.
