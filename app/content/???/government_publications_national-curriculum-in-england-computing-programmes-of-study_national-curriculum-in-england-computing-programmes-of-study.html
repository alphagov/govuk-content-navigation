      Purpose of study
     </h3>
     <p>
      A high-quality computing education equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world. Computing has deep links with mathematics, science and design and technology, and provides insights into both natural and artificial systems.  The core of computing is computer science, in which pupils are taught the principles of information and computation, how digital systems work and how to put this knowledge to use through programming. Building on this knowledge and understanding, pupils are equipped to use information technology to create programs, systems and a range of content. Computing also ensures that pupils become digitally literate – able to use, and express themselves and develop their ideas through, information and communication technology – at a level suitable for the future workplace and as active participants in a digital world.
     </p>
     <h3 id="aims">
      Aims
     </h3>
     <p>
      The national curriculum for computing aims to ensure that all pupils:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       can understand and apply the fundamental principles and concepts of computer science, including abstraction, logic, algorithms and data representation
      </li>
      <li>
       can analyse problems in computational terms, and have repeated practical experience of writing computer programs in order to solve such problems
      </li>
      <li>
       can evaluate and apply information technology, including new or unfamiliar technologies, analytically to solve problems
      </li>
      <li>
       are responsible, competent, confident and creative users of information and communication technology
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="attainment-targets">
      Attainment targets
     </h3>
     <p>
      By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study.
