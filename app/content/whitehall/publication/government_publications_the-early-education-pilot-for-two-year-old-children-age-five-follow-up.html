           The original evaluation of the early education pilot for 2-year-old children compared the outcomes for children in the pilot when they were aged 3 with a comparison group of children who were matched on a range of characteristics. This report looks at the same children’s outcomes when they are aged 5 to explore if there are any longer-term benefits for the children who took part in the pilot. The outcome data is taken from the early years foundation stage (EYFS) assessments. These are carried out in schools by teachers in the year that children turn five.
          </p>
          <p>
           This study also examines if children who took part in the pilot were more likely to take up early education when they were 3- or 4-years-old. This is an indirect measure of the pilot’s benefit as attending high quality early education has a positive effect on children’s outcomes. Both the EYFS data and the data on take-up of early years education at age three or four were extracted from the national pupil database (NPD).
