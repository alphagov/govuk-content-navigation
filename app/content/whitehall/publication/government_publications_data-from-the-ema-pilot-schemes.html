       Can the department explain why the data from the pilot schemes was considered to show that
       <abbr title="Education maintenance allowance">

       was ineffective as a scheme? Please make this data available and provide an explanation of why it shows

      <p>
       In reaching the decision to end
       <abbr title="Education maintenance allowance">
        EMA
       </abbr>
       the government has looked closely at evaluation evidence and other research, which indicate that the availability of
       <abbr title="Education maintenance allowance">
        EMA
       </abbr>
       has not been a determining factor in young people’s participation or the choices they make about continuing in education and training after the age of 16.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/barriers-to-participation-in-education-and-training">
        ‘Barriers to participation in education and training’
       </a>
       research reported that only 12% of young people in receipt of
       <abbr title="Education maintenance allowance">
        EMA
       </abbr>
       said that they would not have participated without it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This research is in line with findings from evaluations of
       <abbr title="Education maintenance allowance">
        EMA
       </abbr>
       commissioned by the Learning and Skills Council and conducted by the Institute of Fiscal Studies (
       <abbr title="Institute of Fiscal Studies">
        IFS
       </abbr>
       ). An evaluation of the
       <abbr title="Education maintenance allowance">
        EMA
       </abbr>
       pilots was conducted by a consortium led by the Centre for Research into Social Policy (
       <abbr title="Centre for Research into Social Policy">
        CRSP
       </abbr>
       ) and involving the
       <abbr title="Institute of Fiscal Studies">
        IFS
       </abbr>
       and the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen). The main aims of the evaluation were to assess the impact of
       <abbr title="Education maintenance allowance">
        EMA
       </abbr>
       on participation, retention and achievement in post-16 education.
      </p>
      <p>
       The research by the
       <abbr title="Institute of Fiscal Studies">
        IFS
       </abbr>
       and
       <abbr title="Centre for Research into Social Policy">
        CRSP
       </abbr>
       has shown previously that
       <abbr title="Education maintenance allowance">
        EMA
       </abbr>
       would increase participation in post-16 education by 4 percentage points and up to 9 percentage points for the poorest young people. This is consistent with the conclusion of the
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/barriers-to-participation-in-education-and-training">
        ‘Barriers to participation in education and training’
       </a>
       research.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the evaluation reports are publicly available from the publications section.
      </p>
      <p>
       The available evidence shows that, while
       <abbr title="Education maintenance allowance">
        EMA
       </abbr>
       does have an impact on participation, that impact is small compared to the proportion of learners receiving it and, hence, the overall cost of the scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since
       <abbr title="Education maintenance allowance">
        EMA
       </abbr>
       was introduced, patterns of participation in education and training have changed significantly, and an incentive-based scheme is no longer an appropriate - or affordable - means of ensuring that those young people, who really need support, get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regards to ’information on departmental policy on programme reviews’, in relation to  the
       <abbr title="Education maintenance allowance">
        EMA
       </abbr>
       programme; the context of the decision to end the scheme and replace it with enhanced discretionary learner support funding as announced in the spending review, the department can confirm that discussions on distributional impacts, including impacts on equality, informed the process for spending review policy discussions and decisions, and that this department worked closely with HM Treasury to assess the impact of spending review decisions on different sections of society.
