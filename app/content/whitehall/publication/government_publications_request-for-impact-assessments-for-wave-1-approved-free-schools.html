      Impact assessments for wave 1 approved free schools: for free schools in the pre-opening stage, the Secretary of State for Education is required to complete an assessment of the impact that the opening of a new school will have on other state-funded educational institutions in the local area. Ministers consider the impact on local schools before deciding whether to enter into a funding agreement with a free school.
