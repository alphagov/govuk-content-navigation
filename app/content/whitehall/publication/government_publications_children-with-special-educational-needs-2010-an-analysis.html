      Pupils with special educational needs (
      <abbr title="Special educational needs">
       SEN
      </abbr>
      ) have learning difficulties or disabilities that make it harder for them to learn than most pupils of the same age. One in every five pupils has a special educational need; about 1.7 million. This is a large and very important group of young learners.
     </p>
     <p>
      The government is determined to improve the outcomes achieved by children and young people with
      <abbr title="Special educational needs">
       SEN
      </abbr>
      . The information in this publication will help teachers, parents, school governing bodies, local authorities and those they work with to assess the quality and efficiency of the provision they make with a view to improving those outcomes.
     </p>
     <p>
      This publication brings together data from a number of important public sources and is part of an effort to improve transparency, especially for parents.
