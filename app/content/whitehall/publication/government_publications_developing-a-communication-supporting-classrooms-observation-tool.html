           The Better Communication Research Programme (BCRP) was commissioned as part of the Better Communication Action Plan, the government’s response to the Bercow review of services for children and young people with speech, language and communication needs. This had recommended a programme of research ‘to enhance the evidence base and inform delivery of better outcomes for children and young people’.

           This is one of 10 publications reporting the results from individual BCRP projects. These contribute to a series of four thematic reports and the main report on the BCRP overall in which we integrate findings and present implications for practice, research and policy from the BCRP as a whole.

           This study comprised the development of a Communication Supporting Classrooms Observation Tool (CsC Observation Tool) for Reception and Key Stage 1 classrooms. This was devised following a review of the research literature.
          </p>
          <p>
           The ‘Developing a Communication Supporting Classrooms Observation Tool’ study is one part of the BCRP. Its aim was to develop a tool to profile features of communication supporting classrooms in Reception and Key Stage 1, pilot its feasibility in classrooms and examine the flexibility and efficacy of its’ use by practitioners. The identification of the features to be included in the tool was derived from a comprehensive review of the relevant research literature to ensure that the components of the tool were informed by evidence.
