      In its 21st report, the STRB made recommendations about how the current arrangements for teachers’ pay should be reformed to raise the status of the profession, support professional development, and reward teachers in line with their contribution to improving pupil outcomes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary of State’s remit letter to the STRB, on 17 January 2013, asked them to make recommendations about:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       how to provide a simplified and flexible framework for ensuring school leaders’ pay is appropriate to the challenge of the post and their contribution to their school or schools
      </li>
      <li>
       how the current detailed provisions for allowances, other pay flexibilities and safeguarding could be reformed to allow a simpler and more flexible school teachers’ pay and conditions document
      </li>
      <li>
       how the framework for teachers’ non-pay conditions of service could be reformed to raise the status of the profession and support the recruitment and retention of high quality teachers, and raise standards of education for all children
      </li>
     </ul>
