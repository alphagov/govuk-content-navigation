      As qualifications from each exam board (called specifications) are accredited, we will list them in this document.
     </p>
     <p>
      Accredited qualifications must meet the minimum requirements set out in our criteria to ensure they are, and will remain, valid and fit for purpose.
     </p>
     <p>
      Accreditation is an on-going process and we are committed to reviewing submissions from the exam boards as quickly as possible. If a qualification is not ready to be accredited, we communicate this clearly to the exam board so they can make the necessary changes as quickly as possible. They then resubmit the qualification for us to look at again.
