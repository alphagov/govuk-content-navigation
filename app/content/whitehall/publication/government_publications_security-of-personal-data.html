           Now that the department has control over Social Work and Children’s Law does this mean any teacher/anyone at the local education department can access personal data?

          <p>
           How is personal data being protected and kept private from members of council departments and which data is kept private (unless ordered otherwise by a judge) and whom exactly has the right to access any/all our data as and when they want to?

           This department has the lead responsibility for children’s policy in England. Professionals working in children’s services in local authorities (
           <abbr title="Local authorities">
            LAs
           </abbr>
           ) in England may have access to personal information about children which it holds where necessary and appropriate for the performance of their functions.
           <abbr title="Local authorities">
            LAs
           </abbr>
           will have their own organisational policies around the handling of personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
           All processing of personal data will need to comply with the Data Protection Act and other relevant legislation. There are also statutory provisions requiring Schools and
           <abbr title="Local authorities">
            LAs
           </abbr>
           to share specified personal information with the department.
          </p>
          <p>
           If a child is at risk of harm there may be a clear and legitimate purpose to share information. Sharing of information when there is concern about a child’s welfare will enable professionals to consider jointly how to proceed in the best interests of the child and to safeguard children more generally. In deciding whether there is a need to share information professionals should consider their legal obligations, including whether they have a duty of confidentiality to the child.
          </p>
          <p>
           Where there is such a duty, the professional may lawfully share information if the child consents or if there is a public interest of sufficient force. This must be judged by the professional on the facts of each case. Where there is a clear likelihood of a child suffering significant harm the public interest test will almost certainly be satisfied.
          </p>
