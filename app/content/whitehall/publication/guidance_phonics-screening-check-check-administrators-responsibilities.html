         The phonics screening check should be administered during the week commencing 15 June. If a pupil is absent they can take the check until Friday 26 June.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you are a check administrator you should prepare by familiarising yourself with the
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/phonics-screening-check-administration">
          check administration guidance

          information about keeping check materials secure
         </li>

          instructions for administering the check, including how to score pupils’ responses
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Your headteacher is responsible for arranging training to make sure you are ready for the check. As a result you should understand and feel confident about:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          administering the check
         </li>

         Prepare the room for the phonics screening check
        </h2>
        <p>
         The phonics screening check must be administered on a one-to-one basis in a room which is quiet and provides a comfortable, well lit space. The room must be prepared before pupils are admitted. This means removing any displays or materials that could help pupils in the check.
        </p>
        <h2 id="security-of-phonics-screening-check-materials">
         Security of phonics screening check materials
        </h2>
        <p>
         It is important that the security of the check materials is maintained until the end of the check period on Friday 26 June (the last date a pupil may take the check). This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the check is maintained so that no pupil has an unfair advantage over another.
        </p>
        <p>
         You must not share the check words with anyone not directly involved with the administration of the check. This includes other staff at the school or other schools, any online forums and family members.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you suspect a breach of security regarding the check materials, report the incident immediately to the
         <a href="#helpline">
          national curriculum assessments helpline
         </a>
         . The Standards and Testing Agency will then investigate the incident and take action where appropriate.

        <h3 id="rest-breaks">

        <p>
         Each pupil will usually take between 4 and 9 minutes to complete the phonics screening check, however there isn’t a time limit. You should give pupils enough time to respond to each word.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you believe a pupil will find it difficult to concentrate or may experience fatigue during the check, you may use rest breaks to make it more manageable. Rest breaks can be taken when needed. When planning for the check, consider when it would be most appropriate for the pupil to take a break. If the pupil is likely to need a rest break more frequently than between the 2 sections of the check or at the end of a page, we recommend you modify the materials so there are fewer words on each page.
        </p>
        <p>
         The pupil must be kept isolated from the rest of the cohort during the rest break. The check must be completed on the same day.

         If the pupil is familiar with cued speech it can be used by a professional skilled in cued speech and by the deaf pupil to make their responses clear for all words. If the deaf pupil would prefer to speak the words then cued speech should be used to help clarify what sounds they were aiming for.

         You should introduce the phonics screening check as consistently as possible, bearing in mind some pupils may require more explanation in order to understand the task.
        </p>
        <p>
         The check materials include a double-sided ‘practice sheet’ with 4 pseudo-words and 4 real words on each side. You can use this to familiarise pupils with the task. If a pupil is struggling to decode the words on the ‘practice sheet’ you should stop the check and discuss with your headteacher whether the pupil should participate in the check.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the practice, you can give further guidance to ensure pupils understand the task. For example, you may remind the pupil that the word must be blended, which wouldn’t be allowed during the check itself.
        </p>
        <p>
         The following text provides an example of how you could introduce the check.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          In this activity, I am going to ask you to read some words aloud.
         </li>
         <li>
          You may have seen some of the words before and others will be new to you.
         </li>
         <li>
          You should try to read each word but don’t worry if you can’t. If it helps you, you may sound out the letters before trying to say the word.
         </li>
         <li>
          This ‘practice sheet’ shows you what the words will look like.
         </li>
         <li>
          Have a go at reading out loud these 4 words which you should have come across before [at, in, beg and sum].
         </li>
         <li>
          The words on this side [turn over ‘practice sheet’] are not real words. They are names for types of imaginary creatures. You can see a picture of the creature next to each word.
         </li>
         <li>
          Can you read out the words on this page for me [ot, vap, osk and ect]?
         </li>
         <li>
          Ok, now we are going to start reading out the words in this booklet and I’m going to write down what you say on my sheet.
         </li>
         <li>
          In this booklet there are 4 words on each page. I will tell you at the start of each page whether they are real words that you may have seen before or names for types of imaginary creatures.
         </li>
         <li>
          The first page has names for types of imaginary creatures and you can see their pictures.
         </li>
         <li>
          Can you start reading the words to me?
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         It is important to tell the pupil whether they are real words or types of imaginary creatures on each page.
        </p>
        <p>
         You can point to whole words to indicate which word comes next but you must be careful not to point to the words in a way that indicates how to decode them. Avoid, for example, pointing from left to right or hovering over letters.

         Complete the ‘Phonics screening check: answer sheet’
        </h2>
        <p>
         You should use the ‘answer sheets’ to record each pupil’s responses during the check so that you have an accurate record of how many words a pupil reads correctly. You can also use them to record your own comments, for example any graphemes a pupil didn’t recognise or when blending was difficult. This may help you plan future phonics teaching.

         Overview
        </h3>
        <p>
         You should score the phonics screening check as the pupil works through each word in order. For each word, you should make a record on the answer sheet of whether the pupil said the word correctly or not, considering the following points.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          If a pupil sounds out the phonemes but doesn’t blend the word, they must not be prompted to do so and this must be scored as incorrect.
         </li>
         <li>
          Pupils may elongate phonemes but if they leave gaps between phonemes and don’t  blend them, this must be scored as incorrect.
         </li>
         <li>
          Alternative pronunciations must be considered when deciding whether a response is correct. For real words, inappropriate grapheme-phoneme correspondences must be marked as incorrect (for  example, reading ‘blow’ to rhyme with ‘cow’ would be incorrect). However, alternative pronunciations of graphemes will be allowed in pseudo-words. The scoring guidance gives some alternative pronunciations however the list of acceptable pronunciations is not exhaustive.
         </li>
         <li>
          A pupil’s accent should be taken into account when deciding whether a response is acceptable but there must be no bias for or against pupils with a particular accent.
         </li>
         <li>
          Any pronunciation difficulties should be taken into account when deciding whether a response is acceptable. For example, a pupil unable to form the ‘th’ sound who instead usually says ‘fw’ should have this scored as correct.
         </li>
         <li>
          If a pupil shows their ability to decode by correcting an attempt, this should be marked as correct. However, pupils must not be prompted to ‘have another go’ and the final attempt must be scored, even if this is incorrect and a previous attempt had been correct.
         </li>
         <li>
          You should not indicate whether a pupil has decoded a word correctly or not during the administration of the check; you may offer encouragement or support.
         </li>
         <li>
          Pupils should be given as long as necessary to respond to a word, although in most cases 10 seconds should be enough.
         </li>
         <li>
          You should decide when it is appropriate to tell the pupil to move onto the next word, taking care not do so while they are still trying to decode the word.
         </li>
        </ul>

         You must ensure that nothing you say or do during the phonics screening check could be interpreted as giving pupils an advantage. For further help and guidance, contact the

          national curriculum assessments helpline
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Most pupils should be able to attempt all words in the check. However, it is important that pupils should not become distressed or have a negative experience during the check.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a pupil is struggling with the check, you should give careful consideration to stopping it before the end.
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, if a pupil is showing signs of fatigue, you should consider using a rest break. If a pupil needs frequent lengthy rest breaks, think about stopping the check completely.

        <p>
         When making the decision to stop, you should ensure that the pupil has been given the full opportunity to show what they can do. If the check is stopped before the end, you should report the pupil’s score for what they have attempted.
