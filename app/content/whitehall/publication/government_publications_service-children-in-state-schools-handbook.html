      Service children in state schools (
      <abbr title="Service children in state schools">
       SCISS
      </abbr>
      ) was formed as a working group to look into the issues relating to English state schools providing for children whose parents serve in the armed forces. It was convened by
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/childrens-education-advisory-service">
       Children’s Education Advisory Service (
       <abbr title="Children's Education Advisory Service">
        CEAS
       </abbr>
       )
      </a>
      in the latter part of 2003.
      <abbr title="Children's Education Advisory Service">

      is a UK, wide Ministry of Defence (
      <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">
       MOD

      ) service which provides information, guidance and support to service families, schools and local authorities and, since 2010, has been part of the

      The
      <abbr title="Service children in state schools">
       SCISS
      </abbr>
      handbook is intended to be a supportive resource, written largely by practitioners in schools for their peers. It is not a directive. The specific implications of providing for children of service personnel and working with their families relate essentially to service-induced mobility and deployment. The handbook addresses each of these issues in turn and the resources available to schools. Although
      <abbr title="Service Children’s Education">
       SCE
      </abbr>
      ’s resource is primarily for its own schools which operate within a framework modeled very closely on the English system, the children on roll there come from and return to schools all over the UK but, in the main, England.
