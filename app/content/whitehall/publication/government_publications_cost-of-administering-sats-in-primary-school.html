      The Standards and Testing Agency (
      <abbr title="Standards and Testing Agency">
       STA
      </abbr>
      ) is responsible for developing and delivering the key stage 2 statutory national curriculum tests (which you refer to as
      <abbr title="standard attainment tests">
       SATs
      </abbr>
      ) tests, the key stage 1 phonics screening check as well as other non-statutory tests.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the financial year 2012 to 2013,
      <abbr title="Standards and Testing Agency">
       STA
      </abbr>
      ’s annual programme budget was £35.7m and the administration budget was £5.4m. The 2012 to 2013 expenditure (once signed off) will be included within
      <abbr title="Standards and Testing Agency">
       STA
      </abbr>
      ’s annual report which will be published on the GOV.UK website. (This should be available by the end of July 2013).

     <p>
      The latest available expenditure details are for financial year 2011 to 2012 and the table below gives the requested breakdown. Please note that
      <abbr title="Standards and Testing Agency">
       STA
      </abbr>
      was created as an executive agency of the Department for Education in October 2011 and so the expenditure is for 6 months only (ie October 2011 to March 2012).
