     <p>
      In recent years significant progress has been made in raising standards for children in primary schools. Many individual children from minority ethnic groups, including those for whom English is an additional language (EAL), are achieving impressive results. However, this is not true for all children who are learning EAL or learning through EAL.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a strong emphasis in Excellence and Enjoyment: a strategy for primary schools, which outlines the Primary National Strategy, on personalising learning to meet individual children’s needs and on ensuring that the education system is not discriminating against any particular group of children.
     </p>
     <p>
      Personalised learning aims to tailor education to ensure that every child achieves and reaches the highest standards possible and involves adapting educational provision to meet the needs and aspirations of individual learners to maximise their achievement and create independent, lifelong learners. Schools are encouraged to establish their own approaches to personalising learning, depending on their local context and unique circumstances.
     </p>
     <p>
      These materials aim to contribute to this process by providing resources tailored to meet the identified aspects that impact on EAL learners in terms of achieving their potential in writing at the end of Key Stage 2.
