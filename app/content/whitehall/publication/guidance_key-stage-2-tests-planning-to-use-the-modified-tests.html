          NCA tools website
         </a>
         . At the end of each test, test administrators should make a note of which pupils used a scribe and give the information to their headteacher. The headteacher must use this information to complete the notification form once all tests have been completed. It must be submitted before the headteacher’s declaration form.

         Pupils with a visual impairment

        <p>
         Where a scribe supports a pupil with a visual impairment, it must be clear to the marker what work the scribe has done and what work is the pupil’s. On diagrams requiring completion, it must be clear where the pupil has indicated the answer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Any diagram which has been transcribed must show evidence of the pupil’s work (for example pin marks). Our markers won’t accept diagrams that have been transcribed without such indication.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a scribe supports a braillist, the pupil’s answers should be recorded on plain paper in a numbered list. Don’t respond using the standard version of the test paper. Diagrams showing evidence of the pupil’s work should be attached to the scribe’s test script (answer booklets or test papers containing pupils’ answers) and sent for marking.

         A communicator may record the signed responses of a pupil who uses British sign language or other sign-supported communication in the mathematics tests, if this is normal classroom practice. You must have appropriate documentation to support your decision to use a scribe in this way. You must also follow our
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/key-stage-2-tests-how-to-use-access-arrangements#scribes">

        </p>
        <p>
         Pupils may sign their responses to the scribe. The scribe must note the pupil’s answer as precisely as possible on the test paper, without inferring any meaning that was not clear in the pupil’s signed responses. Pupils mustn’t be able to see other pupils signing their responses.

        <h3 id="readers">

        <h3 id="communicators-and-sign-language-interpreters">
         Communicators and sign language interpreters
        </h3>
        <p>
         Communicators and sign language interpreters may support pupils who use British sign language or other sign-supported communication in the tests if this is normal classroom practice. The instructions which accompany the test materials give suggested rephrasing of words and sentences which may be signed.
        </p>
        <p>
         When communicators and sign language interpreters sign questions to pupils, they may change individual words or the order of the words.  However, make sure they understand that they must not:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          alter the meaning of the question
         </li>
         <li>
          explain elements which are part of the mathematical understanding of the question
         </li>
         <li>
          indicate or imply the answer through their signs
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         For example, when signing ‘fraction’ they need to be careful not to sign the answer, or any particular fraction given in the text which may suggest either a correct or incorrect answer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Teachers often develop their own signs for subject-specific words as there isn’t always a clear sign. You may need to explain these to communicators and sign language interpreters so that they know how they should sign certain parts of the mathematics tests.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some questions in the mathematics tests may refer to past or future events, or words or diagrams used earlier in a question. In such instances, you may give pupils reminders or repeat parts of a question.
        </p>
        <h4 id="how-to-sign-or-communicate-the-test-to-pupils">
         How to sign or communicate the test to pupils
        </h4>
        <p>
         We don’t give specific guidance for all questions or parts of questions. Make sure your communicators and interpreters are aware of the following general advice.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          In general, signers should be positioned in ‘neutral space’ away from the test papers, unless the guidance notes specifically advise a communicator to refer to a part of a test question.
         </li>
         <li>
          Any familiar signs may be used, but care must be taken not to convey the answer with the sign chosen.
         </li>
         <li>
          If the familiar sign conveys the meaning of the mathematical term, or if no sign is known, the words may be finger spelled, or pointed to in the test paper, but not explained.
         </li>
         <li>
          All questions may be simplified by separating the statement and response elements, and giving the statement first. For example, ‘Tick one box to show which mass is greater’ may be signed or explained as, ‘Which mass is greater? Tick one box’.
         </li>
         <li>
          ‘Fill in’ and ‘give’, may be signed or explained as ‘write’. The instruction ‘calculate’ may be signed or explained as ‘work out’ in any of the tests.
         </li>
         <li>
          Unfamiliar proper nouns and names may be clarified by a general sign, for example ‘a boy’, ‘a place’ if they are likely to confuse a pupil.
         </li>
         <li>
          All pronouns may be explained or expanded for example ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘they’, ‘each one’.
         </li>
         <li>
          In questions which require a pupil to tick a box to complete a sentence, the whole sentence may be signed or explained each time.
         </li>
         <li>
          Where a question refers a pupil to look at a particular diagram or chart, you may indicate the object generally, but take care not to indicate any particular feature of the object, or the answer.
         </li>
         <li>
          Where the guidance indicates an alternative phrase for sign communication, the same phrase may be used to explain these terms to oral deaf pupils.
         </li>
         <li>
          When no specific guidance is given, everything must be signed or explained in the way it is presented in the standard test paper, following normal classroom practice.

         You will need additional equipment to administer the mental mathematics test. If you have ordered the CD of stimulus materials, which includes a set of PDF files, you will need a computer with Adobe Reader installed to use this.

        </p>
        <p>
         Some pupils with a severe hearing impairment will need a signal so they understand when they can answer the questions. You could use a light or vibration signal for this purpose.

          A suitable calculator for the level 6 mathematics Paper 2. For some pupils with a visual impairment, this will need to be a calculator with speech output or enhanced display. If specialist calculators are not available, you may assist the pupil in reading the display, or in following their instructions. If a pupil uses a calculator with speech output you should consider administering the tests to them in a separate room so that other pupils aren’t disturbed or given an advantage.

        <p>
         Pupils with a visual impairment will need more space to lay out their test papers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pupils with a hearing impairment who are using the modified versions of the mental mathematics test must do so in a separate room.

        <p>
         You should consider the number of test administrators that will be needed for each room where the tests are being administered. Arrangements should be in place should a pupil need to be removed, for example if they are disruptive or become ill. Pupils with a hearing impairment will need to be supported by a communicator or sign language interpreter who has previously worked with them.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should also consider that test administrators who administer the tests on their own are more vulnerable to allegations of maladministration as they do not have another adult to verify the test administration procedures.

         When you can open test materials

        <p>
         It says on the front of each test pack when the test materials can be opened to prepare for the administration of the tests.
        </p>
        <p>
         You must not open the test packs early to familiarise yourself with the test content. This could lead to allegations of maladministration and the annulment of pupils’ results.

        <p>
         You may open the mathematics model pack(s) up to 2 school days before the relevant test, to check that you have sufficient quantities and to assemble the models.
        </p>
        <p>
         You may wish to provide real objects which look like those illustrated in the tests. Take care to use shapes identical to those drawn and to keep relative sizes the same. Pupils must not experiment with these objects.
        </p>
        <p>
         You are advised to indicate on the test paper where models are available for pupils to handle or look at.

         Braille test papers - print transcriptions
        </h2>
        <p>
         The braille test packs will include printed transcriptions of all braille papers for reference during the administration of the tests. You will receive transcriptions of both the Unified English Braille (
         <abbr title="Unified English Braille">
          UEB
         </abbr>
         ) and Standard English Braille (
         <abbr title="Standard English Braille">
          SEB
         </abbr>
         ) versions of the tests. Before starting the tests check that you are using the correct version. You should also check the printed transcriptions carefully as amendments may be made to the wording of text and questions. A small amount of additional text may be added to explain information that appears as images in the standard version, to clarify visual references.

        <p>
         Where appropriate, changes will have been made to the wording and layout of test questions in the braille and

         versions of the tests.

         If you make further adaptations to the braille or
         <abbr title="modified large print">
          MLP
         </abbr>
         versions of the tests, take care to ensure that the page layout and accuracy of the materials are not affected. If the corresponding text, questions or page references are adapted incorrectly, pupils may be disadvantaged.
        </p>
        <p>
         The braille versions of the tests are produced in contracted (grade 2) braille. The capital letter sign is used within the braille materials. These materials may be re-brailled in a mixture of uncontracted (grade 1) and contracted (grade 2) braille and without the capital letter sign if this is more suited to normal classroom practice.
        </p>
        <p>
         There may be questions in the
         <abbr title="modified large print">
          MLP

         versions of the mathematics tests that are unsuitable for further enlargement. These will be listed in the instructions included in each test pack.
