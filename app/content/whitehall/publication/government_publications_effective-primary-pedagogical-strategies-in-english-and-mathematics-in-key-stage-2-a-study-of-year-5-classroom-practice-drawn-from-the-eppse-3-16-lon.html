       EPPSE
      </abbr>
      3-16) project is a large-scale, research study that has followed the progress of 3000+ children since 1997.

     <p>
      A continuing question for
      <abbr title="effective provision of pre-school, primary and secondary education">
       EPPSE
      </abbr>
      was whether pre- and primary school experiences or children’s early home learning environment could reduce inequality. This research aimed to examine the differences between poor, average and excellent teachers, and how their teaching practices could be linked to the effectiveness of schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also important, and particularly relevant to this study, was the extent to which educational influences (pre-school and primary school quality and effectiveness) also shaped children’s educational outcomes.
