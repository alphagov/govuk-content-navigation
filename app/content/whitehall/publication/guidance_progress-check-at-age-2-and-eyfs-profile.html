         sets the standards for development, learning and care of children from birth to age 5.
        </p>
        <p>
         Providers need to carry out 2 main assessments of the children in their care:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          the
          <abbr title="Early Years Foundation Stage">
           EYFS
          </abbr>
          progress check at age 2, which consists of a short written summary of a child’s development when they are between 24 and 36 months
         </li>
         <li>
          the
          <abbr title="Early Years Foundation Stage">
           EYFS
          </abbr>
          profile, which summarises and describes a child’s attainment at the end of the
          <abbr title="Early Years Foundation Stage">
           EYFS
          </abbr>
          (ie at age 5)
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Both assessments look at a child’s progress in the following 7 areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          prime areas of learning:
          <ul>
           <li>
            communication and language
           </li>
           <li>
            physical development
           </li>
           <li>
            personal, social and emotional development
           </li>
          </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
          specific areas of learning:
          <ul>
           <li>
            literacy
           </li>
           <li>

         The
         <abbr title="Early Years Foundation Stage">
          EYFS
         </abbr>
         requires providers to supply parents and carers with a short written summary of every child’s development when they are between 24 and 36 months old. This progress check allows practitioners to identify which children need additional support.
        </p>
        <p>
         The progress check concentrates on the 3 prime learning and development areas of the
         <abbr title="Early Years Foundation Stage">
          EYFS
         </abbr>
         :

         </li>

         <abbr title="Early Years Foundation Stage">

         does not require for the progress check at age 2 to be completed in a standard format.
        </p>

         </abbr>
         profile assessments comply with statutory requirements and are consistent with national standards, local authorities provide annual training for practitioners and carry out moderation visits to early years settings in their area. All providers are visited regularly as part of a moderation cycle.

         <abbr title="Early Years Foundation Stage">
          EYFS
         </abbr>
         profile assessments begins within each individual setting. To ensure consistency, practitioners should agree profile judgements with other professionals within their own settings. They may also wish to work with practitioners from other settings.

         Detailed advice on moderation is available from section 6 of the
