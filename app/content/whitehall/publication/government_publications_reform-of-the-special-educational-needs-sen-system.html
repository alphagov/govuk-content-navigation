      I would like to know what research and sources of information were used to draft government policies on special educational need which have been published in the last 2 years and which have been implemented in 2012 or are expected will be implemented in the next few years.

      In developing
      <abbr title="special educational needs">
       SEN
      </abbr>
      policy in the last 2 years we have drawn on publications listed in the bibliography to the
      <a href="https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/CM%208027" rel="external">
       <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">
        SEND
       </abbr>
       green paper ‘Support and aspiration: a new approach to special educational needs (2011)’
      </a>
      , and also some of the materials listed in bibliographies to documents cited within the green paper.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since the publication of the green paper there have been a number of other pieces of research that the department has published that are influencing decisions around the implementation of the reforms. These are:
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="/government/publications/individual-budgets-for-families-with-disabled-children">
       ‘Individual budgets for families with disabled children: final evaluation report’
      </a>
      – the initial period reported in 2011, are available online.
     </p>
     <p>
      This was then followed by
      <a href="/government/publications/evaluation-of-the-extended-individual-budget-pilot-programme-for-families-with-disabled-children-the-extended-packages">
       an extended year of evaluation
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The national evaluation of
      <a href="/government/publications/achievement-for-all-national-evaluation">
       ‘Achievement for all national evaluation’
      </a>
      was published in 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      The evaluation of the impact of short breaks on families with disabled children over time. A number of reports are available including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <a href="/government/publications/the-impact-of-short-breaks-on-families-with-a-disabled-child-over-time-the-second-report-from-the-quantitative-study">
        ‘The impact of short breaks on families with a disabled child over time: the second report from the quantitative study’
       </a>
      </li>
      <li>
       <a href="/government/publications/the-impact-of-short-breaks-on-families-with-a-disabled-child-report-one-of-the-quantitative-phase">
        ‘The impact of short breaks on families with a disabled child: report 1 of the quantitative phase’
       </a>
      </li>
      <li>
       <a href="/government/publications/a-report-on-themes-emerging-from-qualitative-research-into-the-impact-of-short-break-provision-on-families-with-disabled-children">
        ‘A report on themes emerging from qualitative research into the impact of short break provision on families with disabled children’
       </a>
      </li>

       </a>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      It would also be worth noting the
      <a href="/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/research#better-communication-research-programme-bcrp">
       Better communication research programme (
       <abbr title="Better communication research programme">
        BCRP
       </abbr>
       )
      </a>
      ,  which was a 3 year programme of research around speech, language and communication needs and was published in December 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/send/changingsen/b00218822/evaluation-send-pathfinder" rel="external">
       ‘Evaluation of the
       <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">
        SEND
       </abbr>
       pathfinder programme’ green paper and initial documents
      </a>
      may also be of interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      We are expecting a larger research report of the pathfinder evaluation to be published this in autumn 2013, concluding the first phase of the evaluation. This should be available online once published.
