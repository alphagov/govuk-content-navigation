      The children’s workforce operates within a complex legislative and policy context, with strong social, economic and political drivers. Social workers need to work to a range of legislative and statutory guidance and this should be underpinned by the value base and principles that are part of being a professional social worker.
     </p>
     <p>
      The EPD outcome statements are designed to be used by social workers and their supervisors in all settings where children and young people are at the centre of the social work task.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of the guidance is to help social workers understand what can be expected of them in the second and third years of their professional career. The expectations at this stage of professional development are greater than those made of newly qualified social workers (NQSWs). The guidance covers the six outcome statements that have been created to guide thinking, professional behaviour, skills, knowledge and professional values.
