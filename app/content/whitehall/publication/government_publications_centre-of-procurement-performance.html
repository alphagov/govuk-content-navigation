          <p>
           In respect of the UK Darlington Administration Services notice summary, those suppliers who applied for inclusion, those who were successful / unsuccessful at the PQQ and ITT stages, the contract value, start date and duration, and whether the framework agreement is being renewed.
          </p>
          <p>
           With regards to the tender notice (reference 147222-2009), it  was to award a contract, rather than a framework agreement, for the administration of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (TPS).
          </p>
          <p>
           Four companies submitted an expression of interest at the PQQ stage:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Capita Business Services Ltd
           </li>
           <li>
            Hewitt Associates Outsourcing Ltd
           </li>
           <li>
            Mouchel Ltd
           </li>
           <li>
            Paymaster (1836) Ltd
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           All companies were issued with an invitation to participate in dialogue (slightly different to an ITT because the companies were asked to enter into a competitive dialogue). After competitive dialogue was complete, all the companies were invited to submit a best and final offer (BAFO) although one organisation chose not to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
           Following receipt and evaluation of BAFOs from Capita, Mouchel and Paymaster, Capita were successful in being selected as the preferred supplier.
          </p>
          <p>
           The contract started on 24 March 2011 entering into a transitional period before service commencement on 1 October 2011.  The contract is for an initial term of 7 years (from service commencement date) with the option to extend for up to 3 years after. The value of the contract for the initial term is £89m.
