     <p>
      In respect of the UK Darlington Administration Services notice summary, those suppliers who applied for inclusion, those who were successful / unsuccessful at the PQQ and ITT stages, the contract value, start date and duration, and whether the framework agreement is being renewed.
     </p>
     <p>
      With regards to the tender notice (reference 147222-2009), it  was to award a contract, rather than a framework agreement, for the administration of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (TPS).
     </p>
     <p>
      Four companies submitted an expression of interest at the PQQ stage:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Capita Business Services Ltd
      </li>
      <li>
       Hewitt Associates Outsourcing Ltd
      </li>
      <li>
       Mouchel Ltd
      </li>
      <li>
       Paymaster (1836) Ltd
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      All companies were issued with an invitation to participate in dialogue (slightly different to an ITT because the companies were asked to enter into a competitive dialogue). After competitive dialogue was complete, all the companies were invited to submit a best and final offer (BAFO) although one organisation chose not to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      Following receipt and evaluation of BAFOs from Capita, Mouchel and Paymaster, Capita were successful in being selected as the preferred supplier.
     </p>
     <p>
      The contract started on 24 March 2011 entering into a transitional period before service commencement on 1 October 2011.  The contract is for an initial term of 7 years (from service commencement date) with the option to extend for up to 3 years after. The value of the contract for the initial term is £89m.
