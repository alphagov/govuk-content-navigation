      The government’s aim is to transform the school system so that every child receives an excellent education - whatever their background and wherever they live. A vital part of the government’s vision is to create a more diverse education sector offering excellence and choice, where each school has a distinctive character and ethos. Schools work best when taking responsibility for their own school improvement, working closely with other schools and external partners.

      The white paper
      <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130401151715/https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationdetail/page1/Cm%206677" rel="external">
       ‘Higher standards, better schools for all
      </a>
      ’, published in October 2005, sets the framework for the trust school provisions in the Education and Inspections Act 2006. The policy objective is to strengthen the leadership and ethos of schools by enabling them to form long-term sustainable partnerships with charitable trusts which will be able to appoint a majority of the governors, where the existing governing body wishes. The aim is to bring in experience, energy and expertise from new partners as a lever to raise standards, and to take existing collaboration a step further.
