          <p>
           Can the department provide information regarding engagement the department had with stakeholders, who these stakeholders are, and who has been involved in the consultation on the review of the National Curriculum?
          </p>
          <p>
           Further to this, can the department include:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            which schools the ‘teachers and head teachers’ are from
           </li>
           <li>
            which ‘subject associations and other subject experts’ are included
           </li>
           <li>
            which organisations the ‘representatives from further and higher education’ are from
           </li>
           <li>
            which ‘employer representative organisations’ are included
           </li>
           <li>
            which ‘significant employers’ are included
           </li>
           <li>
            any other bodies (not people acting in a personal capacity) who have been included
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Also, who else is planned to be included in any of the above groups during the National Curriculum review?
          </p>
          <p>
           Who are the stakeholders being asked to comment on emerging drafts of the new Programmes of Study?
          </p>

          <p>
           A copy of the information requested is set out below.  It details the dates and type of event, and lists those invited to attend.  Members of the advisory committee and expert panel (membership of which is detailed on the Department for Education’s website) were also present at a number of the events.
          </p>
          <p>
           In addition to these specific events, the department has carried out a public Call for Evidence which received nearly 5800 responses and has had a wide range of one-to-one discussions with stakeholders.
          </p>
          <p>
           Details of the further engagement that the department envisages in the autumn are not yet available but will be published on the website in due course.
