      The aim of the Further Education Learning Technology Action Group (FELTAG) was to identify obstacles preventing further education providers taking full advantage of technology. The group’s recommendations were designed to remove these obstacles, and encourage the further education system towards the digital future expected by learners and employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      In response to feedback from the sector, this document clarifies how the Skills Funding Agency is taking forward its commitments set out in the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-learning-technology-action-group-feltag-recommendations-government-response">
       government’s response to FELTAG ‘s report
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The intention of FELTAG, and the government’s response to it, is to encourage greater use of digital technologies and a better ‘blend’ of online and traditional face-to-face delivery to engage learners and ensure cost effectiveness across the sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Skills Funding Agency is working to ensure that its funding system supports the delivery of online programmes and is undertaking a number of pilots, to look at barriers and obstacles to successful implementation.
     </p>
     <div class="call-to-action">
      <p>
       As part of this overall “temperature check” the Agency would like providers complete a
       <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/onlinetech" rel="external">
        brief survey

       on their current online provision and plans for the future by 14 November.
