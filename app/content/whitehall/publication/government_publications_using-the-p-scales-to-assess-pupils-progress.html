      Performance scales (P scales) are used at the end of key stage 1, key stage 2 and key stage 3 for reporting teacher assessment in English, mathematics and science to the Standards and Testing Agency (
      <abbr title="Standards and Testing Agency">
       STA
      </abbr>
      ). Performance scales are also used for reporting teacher assessment to parents in other national curriculum subjects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Assessing pupils’ progress (
      <abbr title="Assessing pupils’ progress">
       APP
      </abbr>
      ) puts the learner at the heart of assessment. It equips teachers to track pupils’ progress, diagnose strengths and weaknesses and improve teaching and learning.
     </p>
     <p>
      By using the P scales you can personalise the assessment process. You can include pupils with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND) and learning difficulties in this national, structured approach to teacher assessment.
     </p>
     <p>
      This booklet guides teachers in mainstream and special schools on:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       using the
       <abbr title="Assessing pupils’ progress">
        APP
       </abbr>
       approach when reviewing the attainments of pupils who experience difficulties in learning
      </li>
      <li>
       making secure and reliable judgements in relation to the P scales
      </li>
      <li>
       sharing and reporting judgements that are rigorous, sound and consistent
      </li>
      <li>
       improving the teaching and learning of pupils with SEND or learning difficulties, by using assessment information collected over time
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      These materials are designed for teachers, including special educational needs coordinators, assessment coordinators and subject leaders. But others, including teaching assistants and school managers, will find the materials useful.
