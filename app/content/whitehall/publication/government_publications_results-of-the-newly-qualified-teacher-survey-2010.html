      From February to May 2010, the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) surveyed newly qualified teachers (NQTs) who had successfully completed their initial teacher training (ITT) in England during the 2008/09 academic year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The survey aimed to assess the quality of their training and how well it prepared them for their first teaching post, and to identify the pre-initial teacher training activities they took part in and their importance in influencing them to go into teaching.
     </p>
     <p>
      Around 12,500 NQTs completed and returned their questionnaires, a response rate of 39%. The NQTs who responded were broadly representative of the total NQT population (approximately 33,500) who were awarded qualified teacher status (QTS) in 2008/09.
