       Local authorities have a duty in securing the provision of suitable education and training at independent specialist providers to meet the reasonable needs of students with learning difficulties and/or disabilities who are over compulsory school age but under 25 and are subject to a learning difficulty assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This document is issued pursuant to section 72(4) of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 and relates to decisions made by local authorities in relation to continuing placements at independent specialist providers and to new placements at independent specialist providers for the 2012 to 2013 academic year. The Education Funding Agency (EFA) complying with its own obligations will fund independent specialist providers directly in 2012 to 2013 based on decisions made by local authorities.
