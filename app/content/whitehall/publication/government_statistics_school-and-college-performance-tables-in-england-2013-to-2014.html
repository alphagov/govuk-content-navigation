       The performance tables provide information on the attainment of students of sixth-form age in secondary schools and further education sector colleges in the academic year 2013 to 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also show how these results compare with other schools and colleges in a local authority area and in England as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tables report the results of 16- to 18-year-old students at the end of advanced level study in the 2013 to 2014 academic year. All schools and colleges in a local authority area are listed in alphabetical order, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        local authority-maintained secondary schools
       </li>
       <li>
        academies
       </li>
       <li>
        free schools
       </li>
       <li>
        independent schools
       </li>
       <li>
        sixth form colleges
       </li>
       <li>
        other further education sector colleges
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Special schools that have chosen to be included are also listed, as are any sixth-form centres or consortiums that operate in an area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 2013 the performance tables have reported indicators for three separate cohorts:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A level
       </li>
       <li>
        academic
       </li>
       <li>
        vocational
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       To be included in a cohort, a student needs to have taken at least one substantial qualification in one or more of the qualification types. Students following programmes of mixed qualification types may belong to more than one cohort, therefore full-time equivalent (
       <abbr title="full-time equivalent">
        FTE
       </abbr>
       ) figures are provided alongside student numbers.
       <abbr title="full-time equivalent">
        FTE
       </abbr>
       figures take account of the proportion of time a student spends in each cohort based on the size of the qualification.
