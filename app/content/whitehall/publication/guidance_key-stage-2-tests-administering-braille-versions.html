        </ul>
        <p>
         The printed instructions include information about what you should do before, during and after each test. Please follow them carefully in order to avoid accusations of maladministration. The instructions aren’t on GOV.UK because they contain information which must stay confidential until the test period is over.

         Your test pack will contain a copy of the test in Standard English Braille (
         <abbr title="Standard English Braille">
          SEB
         </abbr>
         ) and Unified English Braille (
         <abbr title="Unified English Braille">
          UEB
         </abbr>
         ). You should choose the version of braille that best suits the needs of your pupil(s). You will also get a printed transcript of both versions. Make sure all materials remain secure until the end of the testing period on Friday 22 May.
        </p>
        <p>
         The test materials may include braille contractions. You may tell the pupil what the letters or signs represent if these are unfamiliar to the pupil.
        </p>
        <p>
         The capital sign, italic sign, letter sign and bracket sign are used in all the tests. Other punctuation signs will be used in the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test. You must not explain any punctuation marks in the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test.

        </p>
        <p id="details">
         Pupils using the braille tests are automatically entitled to up to 100% additional time. Use your discretion about whether to use the full amount of additional time, for example with pupils who tire quickly. You should tell the pupil what time they are allowed, including any additional time, before each test starts.

         Braillists will use separate sheets of braille paper and are not expected to record their responses on the test papers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Make sure all test scripts have the following information written on the front cover:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          the pupil’s name, (this must be the same as the name entered in the ‘Pupil registration’ section of the

         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Any separate sheets should be labelled with the information listed above and inserted inside the relevant pupil’s test scripts. If these details have not been provided by the pupil, you should add them at the end of the test session.
        </p>
        <p>
         Braille question papers should not be sent to the marker.

         Making corrections to or transcribing a pupil’s work
        </h3>
        <p>
         If a pupil wishes to correct their work they should do this as clearly as possible. For braillists, we recommend that a series of ‘for’ signs (full six-dot cells) are used to block out the incorrect work. The revised answer should be recorded after this on the same line. If this is difficult, you should write on the test script, indicating the response which the pupil doesn’t wish the marker to consider. This must be done accurately, according to the pupil’s instructions before the pupil leaves the test room.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should only transcribe or overwrite a pupil’s test script if the pupil:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          asks for a correction
         </li>
         <li>
          produces unclear braille that needs to be clarified
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         In either case you should clearly indicate which word or section of braille the transcription refers to.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important that evidence of the pupil’s own response is submitted to the marker.
        </p>
        <p>
         Don’t transcribe onto a standard test paper.

        <p>
         Pupils using braille may need some additional assistance to understand the connection between the length of response required and the number of marks allocated for each answer. The ‘Instructions’ section of the braille question booklet gives guidance on the length of answers needed. The type of answer required and the maximum number of marks will be shown after each question.
        </p>
        <p>
         The braille question booklet will include an example of the multiple choice question format. You should help pupils to identify the correct answer to this example so they are familiar with the method of answering this type of question.
        </p>
        <p>
         Throughout the test, where question responses are labelled with letters, or letters and numbers, pupils may either:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          record the letter and / or number as their chosen answer, eg b, d, 1c, 2a
         </li>
         <li>
          record the answer in full
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Tactile diagrams may be provided where appropriate and are included in the reading booklet. You may stop the clock while braillists examine the diagrams, as they will need additional time to interpret them.

        <p>
         Pupils should work through the question booklet, recording their responses on separate sheets of braille paper.
        </p>
        <p>
         For some questions pupils will be able to record just the letter of the correct answer; for others a word, sentence or phrase may be required.

        <p>
         We don’t produce a braille version of the levels 3-5 or level 6 spelling task booklet. The instructions for administering the braille version of the spelling task are the same as the instructions for the standard version of the test. You will need to make a copy of the standard instructions once they have been opened.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should read the sentences in the standard administrator script as directed. Pupils should spell the target words in a numbered list form in braille.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pupils should use uncontracted braille for the spellings, but if they use contractions you should ask them to spell the word orally. You should also check orally if braille reversals occur. You should then annotate the pupil’s work accordingly. Braille markers will take account of the annotations when marking these test scripts.
        </p>
        <h4 id="level-6-paper-1-extended-task">
         Level 6 Paper 1: extended task
        </h4>
        <p>
         You will receive a separate instruction booklet for braillists. This will include the writing prompt for the extended task.
        </p>
        <p>
         A brailled answer sheet will be provided. This sheet (together with additional braille paper) will be at the back of the extended task booklet. You should remove these before the test starts and give them to the pupils when you introduce the extended task. 
You may help pupils to align their responses with any headings on their braille answer sheet without invalidating the test. The marker won’t expect exact alignment of braille headings and responses.
        </p>
        <p>
         You can give additional braille paper during the task if the pupil needs it. Make sure any additional sheets are labelled with the
         <a href="#details">
          pupil’s details
         </a>
         , as listed above.
        </p>
        <p>
         Braillists should demonstrate the use of capital letters if they use them in their normal classroom work. You should indicate on the pupil’s work if they don’t normally use the capital letter sign.

         You should administer the braille version of the test on a one-to-one basis using the relevant section of the ‘Mental mathematics scripts for pupils with a visual impairment’.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should not refer to the standard version of the test CD or transcript. Instructions, question order and content may differ from the standard test.

        <p>
         The script for administering the braille version of the mental mathematics test may contain additional verbal prompts to help pupils to locate specific items in the braille ‘pupil information booklet’. This information is printed in italics in the modified script. You must use this on the first reading of the question, but you may ignore it on the second reading of the question.

        <p>
         The timings of the braille test differ from the standard test to provide accessibility for pupils with a visual impairment. You may give pupils as much additional time as they need to familiarise themselves with any stimulus material before a test question is read. Once a question has been asked, pupils are allowed some additional time to process the language of the question and record their answer. The additional time is reflected in the modified script. You must adhere to the timings in the script strictly.

        <p>
         Pupils shouldn’t respond on the braille question booklet itself. You must give each pupil blank sheets of braille paper for their answers.
        </p>
        <p>
         For some questions, they may need to respond using the stimulus material or inserts tagged at the back of the test papers. You must ensure that any inserts are attached to the pupil’s brailled test scripts at the end of the test. Don’t send the question booklets for marking.

         Drawings, diagrams and tables
        </h4>
        <p>
         The levels 3-5 and level 6 mathematics Paper 1 and Paper 2 contain a number of diagrams, graphs and pictures. Where necessary, we have simplified or adapted these for pupils with a visual impairment, but they might still need help locating the correct diagrams or clarifying their layout. Compared with the standard versions of the tests, some non-essential diagrams and illustrations may have been omitted from the braille test papers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Make sure any separate sheets where a pupil has recorded their answer is:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          labelled with the
          <a href="#details">

          , as listed above
         </li>
         <li>
          attached to the pupil’s test script at the end of the test

        <h5 id="drawings">
         Drawings
        </h5>
        <p>
         Pupils will need to draw in response to some questions. Where this is the case, pupils should use the method that they think is most appropriate. If appropriate, the area covered by the shape may be shaded, marked or indicated by pins (if used), so that the marker can clearly read it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where braillists need to draw on plastic film, spare copies of the diagrams are provided so that they have the opportunity to make a second attempt if necessary. Where appropriate, you should encourage pupils to use a ruler when drawing a straight line on film. You may need to assist the pupil when labelling these diagrams. Make sure the diagrams are attached to the pupil’s test script at the end of the test.
        </p>
        <p>
         Expected forms of response are as follows.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          A drawing with a stylus on plastic film (a jelly-mat to place the plastic film on is essential).
         </li>
         <li>
          A drawing with pins and bands made by the pupil on either the thermoform or a plastic film sheet, or points shown with adhesive putty. You will remove the pins and bands, or adhesive putty, and indicate their positions by marking / drawing on the sheet (preferably with a permanent marker). Labels should be transcribed as positioned by the pupil.
         </li>
         <li>
          A drawing made by placing cardboard shapes in a particular position. When a diagram is created with several shapes, you should show the outline of the individual components as well as the outline of the whole shape created. For example, a shape made up of 4 triangles should show the 4 triangles and not just the outline of the completed shape.
         </li>
         <li>
          A combination of the above activities.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         It is essential that you mount the diagram on a cork board if pins will be used.
        </p>
        <p>
         Please note that where materials (pins, elastic bands, cardboard shapes, adhesive putty, for example) have been used to ‘draw’ a shape or diagram, these materials should not be sent to the marker.
        </p>
        <h5 id="diagrams">
         Diagrams
        </h5>
        <p>
         Some diagrams may be tagged separately at the back of the test booklet. These are for use on a graph board or jelly mat, or are for pupils to braille on directly. You should detach these diagrams before administering the test so that you can prepare them appropriately. Keep spare copies of the diagrams separate in case they are needed during the test.
        </p>
        <p>
         You may stop the clock if pupils with severe visual impairment need time to interpret diagrams. You may also help the pupil to identify key features of the diagram.

         Tables
        </h5>
        <p>
         If a pupil has to fill out a table, we will either provide:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          labels for pupils to put into the cells of the table
         </li>
         <li>
          a separate copy of the table which pupils should use their braillers to complete
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         You may help the pupil to align their responses within the table.
