      <li>
       brokers are not contracted on performance-related pay schemes
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Q2.  Redacted copies of the contracts for the supply of educational advice in the role of both school broker and sponsor development adviser are attached.
     </p>
     <p>
      The names and other personal information is being withheld because it is exempt under Section 40(2) of the act which provides for personal data, such as names, to be exempt from disclosure where its release, otherwise than under the act, would contravene the principles under the Data Protection Act 1998. This is an absolute exemption and requires no public interest consideration.
     </p>
     <p>
      The number of brokers used by the department has increased due to a very rapid expansion of the academies’ programme, which has opened opportunities up to primary as well as secondary schools. The programme has been successful in raising standards with results in sponsored academies improving at a faster rate than other state-funded schools. The longer they are open the better on average they do, with GCSE results improving far faster than other state-funded schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      Brokers have been instrumental in brokering 510 sponsored academy solutions since September 2010, improving education opportunities for thousands of children. The department has been using brokers on similar contracted arrangements since 2004.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department requires special expertise for the broker role that it cannot find within the civil service. Their expertise needs to be deployed flexibly in different parts of the country. These and other needs are best secured through a contracted service. This type of engagement also achieves value for money for the taxpayer; it would be far more expensive to employ brokers on permanent terms. The department has reduced day rates significantly since 2010 and will continue to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proportion of pupils in sponsored secondary academies that achieved 5 good GCSEs (including English and maths) increased by 3.1 percentage points between 2011 and 2012. This compares with a 0.6 percentage point increase across all state-funded schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amongst sponsored primary academies, the proportion of pupils achieving level 4 or above in mathematics increased by 7 percentage points between 2011 and 2012. This compares with a 4 percentage points increase across all state-funded schools.
