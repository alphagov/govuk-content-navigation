      Request

     <p>
      Can the Department provide data pertaining to the cost of fees/education for SEN pupils in:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       full-time specialist schools - private or state
      </li>
      <li>
       support in mainstream schools - private or state
      </li>
      <li>
       residential versus day care.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <h2 id="release">
      Release
     </h2>
     <p>
      There is a wide variation in the cost of funding for individual pupils as it is dependent upon the individual needs of a child.
     </p>
     <p>
      For pupils placed in non-maintained special schools or independent schools the question of the fees to be paid are a matter between the LA responsible for maintaining the child’s statement and the school at which the child is placed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funding is delegated to LAs who determine how to distribute the funding in accordance with their own local funding formula agreed in consultation with their schools’ forum.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department for Education can disclose that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       planned expenditure on the provision for pupils with special educational needs during the 2009-10 financial year was almost £5.2 billion.
       <br>
       </br>
      </li>
      <li>
       of the £5.2 billion: £2.1 billion was delegated to mainstream schools; £1.6 billion was delegated to maintained special schools; and £612 million was spent on placing children with SEN statements at independent and non-maintained special schools.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The department does not hold any more detailed level of data.
