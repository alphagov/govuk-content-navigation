           Can the Department provide data pertaining to the cost of fees/education for SEN pupils in:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            full-time specialist schools - private or state

           <li>

          <p>
           There is a wide variation in the cost of funding for individual pupils as it is dependent upon the individual needs of a child.
          </p>
          <p>
           For pupils placed in non-maintained special schools or independent schools the question of the fees to be paid are a matter between the LA responsible for maintaining the child’s statement and the school at which the child is placed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Funding is delegated to LAs who determine how to distribute the funding in accordance with their own local funding formula agreed in consultation with their schools’ forum.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Department for Education can disclose that:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            planned expenditure on the provision for pupils with special educational needs during the 2009-10 financial year was almost £5.2 billion.
            <br>
            </br>
           </li>
           <li>
            of the £5.2 billion: £2.1 billion was delegated to mainstream schools; £1.6 billion was delegated to maintained special schools; and £612 million was spent on placing children with SEN statements at independent and non-maintained special schools.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           The department does not hold any more detailed level of data.
