      </h2>
      <p>
       How many state schools have applied to sell off playing fields (land that can be used for grass sports pitches by the pupils) since the coalition government came to power in 2010 and how many of those have been approved?
      </p>
      <p>
       Supplementary questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        How much money has been raised through these sales?
        <br>
         Please provide a list of the sales which names the schools
        </br>
       </li>
       <li>
        If a full list is unavailable, please give a reason why and provide instead a breakdown of how many were primary and how many were secondary and also a regional breakdown.

      <p>
       Local authorities (LAs) do not apply to sell playing fields, they seek consent from the Secretary of State to dispose. A disposal can also include a lease of the playing fields to a third party organisation with the fields still used by the school. The Education Funding Agency do not request information from LAs about whether sites that have been approved for disposal are actually sold. We, therefore, do not hold information about the number of sales, the value of sales, or to whom the sales have been made.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of applications received since May 2010 is 22.
       <br>
        Approval has been given for 19 applications and 3 are under consideration.
