      <p>
       The Department of Education introduced a £42 million musical instrument grant for local authorities. This funding, which ended in 2011, was delivered for the department by the Federation of Music Services:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        £1 million for maintenance and repair in 2006 to 2007 and 2007 to 2008
       </li>
       <li>
        £10 million each in 2007 to 2008; 2008 to 2009; 2009 to 2010 and 2010 to 2011 for instrument purchase
       </li>
      </ul>

        national plan for music education

       in November 2011, which puts the needs of the pupil at the heart of a new approach to music education.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government is fully committed to high-quality music education and this plan will ensure that every child should have opportunities to learn to play a musical instrument, learn to sing, have opportunities to play in ensembles and have access to musical progression routes regardless of where they live and their family circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ministers have protected core music funding for schools, this includes funding to enable outstanding young talent to attend elite specialist schools in music and dance and help 12,000 disadvantaged children enjoy music.
