           This is the 2011 edition of families of schools for Greater Manchester which is based on final 2010 data. The data presented allows users to compare the performance of their school against the performance of other Greater Manchester schools with statistically similar pupil intakes.
          </p>
          <p>
           The first three editions of âFamilies of schools for Greater Manchester primary schoolsâ were published in 2008, 2009 and 2010. As with previous years, this edition includes key stage 2 results, a contextual value added measure and contextual families looking at English as an additional language and mobility.
          </p>
          <p>
           Schools are grouped into families on the basis of an average of their prior attainment data and context data. Prior attainment data is the average key stage 1 attainment, measured by the average point score at key stage 1, for all pupils in year 3 to year 6 who have been matched to key stage 2 data.
          </p>
          <p>
           The data enables schools to compare the outputs of their school against the outputs of others in Greater Manchester with statistically similar pupil intakes. There are many ways in which schools can analyse and use the data.
