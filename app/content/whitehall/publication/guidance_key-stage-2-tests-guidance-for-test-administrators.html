         Each set of test papers will be accompanied by printed instructions. They are designed to help you administer the tests correctly. Please follow the instructions carefully in order to avoid accusations of maladministration. They include information about what you should do before, during and after each test.

        <p>
         Instructions for the braille, modified large print and enlarged print versions of the tests will be included with the test packs. These instructions aren’t on GOV.UK because they contain information which must stay confidential until the test period. You can read the general guidance on

         Opening test packs
        </h2>
        <p id="opening">
         You must not open the test packs early to familiarise yourself with the test content. This can lead to allegations of maladministration and the annulment of pupils’ results.
        </p>
        <p>
         Standard test packs should only be opened when the test is due to start. Packs of modified tests may be opened earlier. It says on the front of each test pack when it can be opened. Exceptions to this are:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          the Standards and Testing Agency has given your headteacher permission to open the test packs more than 1 hour before the tests are scheduled to start
         </li>
         <li>
          your headteacher has agreed that the packs need to be opened in the hour before the tests, to make arrangements for specific pupils
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         If this is the case your headteacher, or
         <abbr title="key stage 2">
          KS2
         </abbr>
         test co-ordinator, will brief you.

         At the start of a test
        </h3>
        <p>
         Two members of staff should collect the test packs from your secure storage. This should be recorded on a log. If there is more than 1 test on the day, packs for a particular test should only be collected when you are ready to administer the test.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should open test packs in front of the pupils in the room(s) where they are going to be administered, immediately before the administration of the tests. You should do this with another member of staff.
        </p>
        <p>
         If tests are being administered in a number of rooms, you may open the packs in 1 room and then take specific pupils and their test papers to the other rooms to administer them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Take care to open the correct pack. If you open the wrong pack, you should speak to your headteacher immediately. They will need to call the
         <a href="#getting-help">
          national curriculum assessments helpline
         </a>
         for advice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once the test pack has been opened, you must not:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          discuss the content of the test papers with anyone
         </li>
         <li>
          use question-specific information to prepare pupils for the test

         Transcribing test papers
        </h2>
        <p>
         When you are preparing for the tests, think about which pupils may need a transcript. Pupils who can’t read their own writing should use a
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/key-stage-2-tests-how-to-use-access-arrangements">
          word processor
         </a>
         or
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/key-stage-2-tests-how-to-use-access-arrangements">
          scribe
         </a>
         if this is part of normal classroom practice.
        </p>
        <p>
         If it will be very difficult for a marker to read a pupil’s writing, you can transcribe all or part of the pupil’s test script.
        </p>
        <h3 id="create-a-transcript">
         Create a transcript
        </h3>
        <p>
         You must follow these instructions when transcribing a pupil’s answers.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Only make a transcript at the end of the test and with another test administrator present.
         </li>
         <li>
          Wherever possible make the transcript with the pupil present, before the pupil leaves the test room. If the pupil needs to leave, for example because of illness, transcribe what you can and send this for marking.
         </li>
         <li>
          Keep the pupil separate from the rest of the cohort until you have completed the transcript.
         </li>
         <li>
          Make the transcript with a blue or black pen where possible. It must be made in a different colour to the one the pupil has used. Do not use red pen.
         </li>
         <li>
          Do not change the pupil’s answers.
         </li>
         <li>
          All punctuation and phrasing must be the pupil’s own. Take particular care when transcribing the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test papers.
         </li>
         <li>
          Do not correct the pupil’s spelling in the spelling test.
         </li>
         <li>
          If the marker can read the pupil’s writing, they will mark the original work. Extensive or full transcripts should be transcribed on the pupil’s test script where possible.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Unless it has been spoiled, send the pupil’s original test script for marking with the transcript.
        </p>
        <h3 id="completing-a-transcript-notification-form">
         Completing a transcript notification form
        </h3>
        <p>
         At the end of each test, test administrators should make a note of which pupils used a transcript and give the information to their headteacher. The headteacher must use this information to complete an online notification form via the ‘Access arrangements’ section of
         <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">
          NCA tools
         </a>
         . The form should be completed once all tests have been completed. It must be submitted before the headteacher’s declaration form.
