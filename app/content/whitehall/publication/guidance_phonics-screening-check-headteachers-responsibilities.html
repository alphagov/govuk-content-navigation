        <p>
         Your school could be subject to a maladministration investigation if it doesn’t comply with the check administration guidance. This comprises:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          guidance on GOV.UK including the ‘
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/key-stage-1-assessment-and-reporting-arrangements-ara">
           Assessment and reporting arrangements
          </a>
          ’
         </li>
         <li>
          information provided with the check materials
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Allegations of maladministration can come from misunderstandings about correct check administration. To help avoid this, make sure all staff, pupils and parents understand how and when the check will be administered.
        </p>
        <h2 id="phonics-screening-check-administrators">
         Phonics screening check administrators
        </h2>
        <p>
         You must ensure that the check is administered on a one-to-one basis by a teacher who is known to the pupil. It must not be administered by a teaching assistant, including higher level teaching assistants, because the role requires a teacher’s professional judgement about which responses are correct. The teacher must not be a relative or carer of the pupil taking the check.
        </p>
        <p>
         It may be helpful for you to hold training sessions, or attend those run by local authorities (
         <abbr title="local authorities">
          LAs
         </abbr>
         ), to ensure those involved in administering the check are fully prepared.
        </p>
        <p>
         Check administrators must be familiar with the
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/phonics-screening-check-check-administrators-responsibilities">
          check administration guidance
         </a>
         . It contains important information about what to do before, during and after the check, in particular:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          information for check administrators
         </li>

        <h2 id="security">
         Security
        </h2>
        <p>
         It is important that the check materials, in particular the ‘Phonics screening check: pupils’ materials’ and ‘2015 Phonics screening check: scoring guidance’, are kept secure at all times. The security of the check must be maintained until the check period ends on Friday 26 June. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the check so that no pupil has an unfair advantage over another.
        </p>
        <p>
         You must make sure that everyone who has access to the check materials understands their responsibility for keeping them secure. The check words must not be shared with anyone who is not directly involved with the administration of the check. This includes other staff at the school or other schools, any online forums and family members.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you suspect a breach of security regarding the check materials, the incident must be reported immediately to the
         <a href="#helpline">
          national curriculum assessments helpline
         </a>
         . The Standards and Testing Agency will then investigate the incident and take action where appropriate.

          Those who didn’t take the check in year 1 because they were absent, were working below the level of the check or had recently arrived in the country and couldn’t speak confidently in English.

         <li>
          Those who didn’t reach the expected standard in year 1.

          Those who entered the schooling system in year 2.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         If pupils in year 2 still don’t understand grapheme-phoneme correspondences or are unable to access the materials, you don’t have to administer the check to them.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a pupil joins a school in year 2, the common transfer file should include information about whether the pupil reached the expected standard in the check in year 1. If this information isn’t provided, you should either contact your
         <abbr title="local authority">
          LA
         </abbr>
         or use the

        <p>
         Pupils who don’t need to take the check again will be indicated by a phonics outcome of ‘Wa’ (pupil took the phonics screening check and met the expected standard). If you can’t establish whether the pupil took the check in year 1, the pupil should take the check in year 2.
        </p>
        <p>
         The check must be administered to year 2 pupils during the week commencing 15 June and in the same way as to year 1 pupils.

        <p>
         You may decide it isn’t appropriate for a pupil to participate in the phonics screening check. Where this is the case, you should explain this to the pupil’s parents. The headteacher’s decision regarding participation is final.
        </p>
        <p>
         You may want to provide a similar experience for pupils who will not formally participate in the check in 2015. You could do this by modifying the ‘practice sheet’ to include only single letters or simple 2 letter blends so they can demonstrate the skills they have learnt. The ‘practice sheet’ and live phonics screening check will be available on the ‘Phonics screening check’ section of the
         <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/Home.aspx" rel="external">

         on Monday 15 June.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a pupil is unable to access the check it is important that teachers are aware of that pupil’s progress in phonics so they can plan the next steps in their teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
         Any pupils who don’t take the check in year 1 must be reconsidered the following year.

         Pupils who are selectively mute

        <p>
         Pupils who are selectively mute will be unable to participate in the phonics screening check if they don’t give verbal responses in school. They may be able to identify the words in the check but will not be able to demonstrate that knowledge by speaking the answers out loud.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pupils who are selectively mute may informally demonstrate their knowledge at home with a family member who can discuss the outcome with the teacher. This arrangement will ensure the pupil has had a similar experience to their peers and give them an opportunity to show their knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
         To avoid potential security issues regarding the check materials, this arrangement can only take place after the end of the check period ends on Friday 26 June.
        </p>
        <p>
         For reporting purposes, the pupil should be recorded as ‘D’ (pupil did not take the phonics screening check) as the results can’t be validated.

         Rooms for the phonics screening check

        <p>
         The phonics screening check should be administered in a room which is quiet and provides a comfortable, well lit space. Rooms must be prepared before pupils are admitted. Displays or materials that could help pupils in the check must be removed or covered for the duration of the check. More than 1 room will be needed if the check will be administered to more than 1 pupil at the same time.

         Arrangements for pupils with specific’ needs
        </h2>
        <p>
         Your school may need to adapt the phonics screening check for some pupils. Adjustments must be made based primarily on normal classroom practice for pupils with specific needs. You don’t need to request our permission to make adaptations, however you must ensure that any changes don’t advantage or disadvantage individual pupils.
        </p>
        <p>
         It may be helpful to use the ‘practice sheet’ with pupils before administering the check. This will enable teachers to identify where it may be appropriate to adapt the materials, eg changing the font or font size.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those who may need adjustments include pupils:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          with a statement of SEN as described in the

         <li>
          for whom provision is being made in school under School Action or School Action Plus of the SEN code of practice and whose learning difficulty or disability significantly affects access to the check
         </li>
         <li>
          with an education, health and care plan (ECHP) or

         </li>
         <li>
          with a disability that doesn’t give rise to a special educational need but requires alternative access arrangements
         </li>
         <li>
          who are unable to sit and work for a sustained period because of a disability or behavioural, emotional or social difficulty

         You must report to parents whether or not their child has met the expected standard to ensure they are aware of their child’s progress in developing phonics skills. This must be done by the end of the summer term at the latest. You can choose how to communicate results to parents.
