      On 3 November 2014 we published our
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accreditation-criterion">
       accreditation criterion
      </a>
      which applies to all qualifications which are subject to an accreditation requirement.
     </p>
     <p>
      In that document, we announced that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       legacy AS and A levels accredited prior to 19 June 2014 in art and design, biology, business, chemistry, computer science, economics, English language, English literature, English language and literature, history, physics, psychology and sociology would cease to be accredited on 31 August 2016
      </li>
      <li>
       all other legacy AS and A levels would cease to be accredited on 31st August 2017
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The references to legacy AS and A levels in business and computer science are incorrect - they should instead have referred to legacy AS and A levels in business studies and computing.
     </p>
     <p>
      This means that - at present - legacy AS and A levels in business studies and computing could be awarded until 31 August 2017. This was not our intention; these qualifications have already been replaced, and their last exams will take place in Summer 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      We have therefore decided to use our powers under section 140(7) of the
      <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/22/section/140" rel="external">
       Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009
      </a>
      to bring forward the accreditation end date for legacy AS and A levels in business studies and computing to 31 August 2016.
