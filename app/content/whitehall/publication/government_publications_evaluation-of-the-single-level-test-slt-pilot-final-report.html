      Single level tests (SLTs) are externally marked tests for key stage 2 pupils. They cover 3 subject areas: mathematics, English reading and English writing. Pupils are entered for a
      <abbr title="Single level test">
       SLT
      </abbr>
      (at a particular Level) when they have been assessed as working at that level and, having achieved that level in the test, progress to the next level and are tested again when they are deemed to be ready.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are 225 primary schools involved in the
      <abbr title="Single level test">
       SLT
      </abbr>
      pilot across 10 local authorities. The evaluation gathered evidence on how the staff, parents/carers and pupils in these schools view the tests and, in particular, the extent to which the arrangements in place were viewed as being manageable in terms of workload and sustainable over time.
     </p>
     <p>
      In November 2009, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) was commissioned by the former Department for Children, Schools and Families (
      <abbr title="Department for Children, Schools and Families">
       DCSF
      </abbr>
      ) to evaluate the
      <abbr title="Single level test">
       SLT
      </abbr>
      pilot. This report presents the findings of the entire evaluation..
     </p>
     <p>
      There were 2 phases to this evaluation. Phase 1 covered the period October 2009 to January 2010. Phase 2 covered the period April to July 2010. The research for both phase 1 and phase 2 was undertaken with all schools in the pilot.
