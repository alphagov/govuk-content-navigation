         The following general guidance will help you prepare for administering the key stage 2 tests. You should follow it to make sure pupils with a hearing impairment can access the tests properly and are not at a disadvantage. You should use this guidance together with the:

        <p>
         The printed instructions include information about what you should do before, during and after each test. Please follow them carefully in order to avoid accusations of maladministration. The instructions aren’t on GOV.UK because they contain information which must stay confidential until the test period is over.

         Levels 3-5 mental mathematics test
        </h2>
        <p>
         A few pupils may need to use modified versions of the mental mathematics test materials. These pupils must take the test in a separate room supported by a communicator or sign language interpreter who has previously worked with them. They must use the standard answer sheet.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have made the following changes to the procedures for administering the modified version of the test.
        </p>
        <h3 id="instructions-for-administrators">
         Instructions for administrators
        </h3>
        <p>
         The ‘Mental mathematics scripts for pupils with a hearing impairment’ includes full instructions and the scripts for administering the modified mental mathematics test. A printed copy will be in your test materials pack. Use the most appropriate administrator script for the pupils being tested. For example, for pupils who have some residual hearing and who are used to lip-reading or who use supported English communication, the oralist and supported English script may be the most appropriate form of communication. For pupils who are more familiar with British sign language, the British sign language script may be preferred.
        </p>
        <h3 id="stimulus-materials">
         Stimulus materials
        </h3>
        <p>
         The test materials include stimulus material for each question. This is available as either flashcards or a CD. You can use these to:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          assist lip-reading
         </li>
         <li>
          help clarify words which might cause confusion acoustically, for example 13 / 30
         </li>
         <li>
          clarify polysyllabic words
         </li>
         <li>
          convey mathematical words which can’t be signed because an iconographic sign may convey the meaning of the concept being tested
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         You should adopt whichever support method is closest to normal classroom practice.
        </p>
        <p>
         You mustn’t use the standard test CD or the standard teacher-read transcript with the stimulus material.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should give pupils as much additional time as they need to register the content of the stimulus material before asking them to concentrate on you as you read the question. The amount of additional time you may allow will vary depending on the nature and degree of each pupil’s impairment. However, you must make sure that the test response times in the modified scripts are strictly adhered to.
        </p>
        <h3 id="timings">
         Timings
        </h3>
        <p>
         The time pupils will have to answer each question will increase from 10 seconds, to 20 seconds, and then to 30 seconds as the test progresses through the 3 sections.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have increased the time so that pupils can process the language, and redirect their attention from the sign language interpreter or communicator and the stimulus material to their answer sheets. This is not to allow them additional response time.
        </p>
        <p>
         You will need to be able to signal to pupils when the response time for each question starts and finishes. You could use a light or vibration signal. You must ensure that pupils recognise the sign or instruction for putting down their pens at the end of the response time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pupils should put down their pens or pencils at the end of the response time for each question. They should then pay you full attention while you show the stimulus material for the next question and read or sign the question.

         Instructions accompany the test materials for levels 3-5 and level 6 Papers 1 and 2. These describe adaptations which you can make, and suggested rephrasing of words and sentences which may be signed. The instructions highlight any questions where you may need to give the pupil further clarification or exemplification.
