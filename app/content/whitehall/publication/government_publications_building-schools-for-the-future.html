      Answer to question 1
     </h3>
     <p>
      The department can confirm that no consultation was held prior to the Secretary of State’s announcement on 5 July. On the same day, the Secretary of State also announced a review into capital expenditure. The Capital Review team sought views and evidence from interested parties related to future capital investment, via a call for written evidence, a number of themed workshops and a programme of face-to-face meetings. The Capital Review team will publish a report at the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ministers and officials have also met and corresponded with a wide range of interested parties since the announcement including MPs, councillors, local authority officials, teachers, pupils, and representatives from private business.
