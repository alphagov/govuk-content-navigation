       Two brokers out of a total of 37 have worked for the department as salaried staff for short periods in their careers. Neither had been civil servants for at least 3 years prior to working as brokers. They were contracted following a fair and open, publicly-advertised tendering process, conducted in full compliance with EC procurement regulations.
