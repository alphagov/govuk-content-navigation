      Schools in the Chorley area receive funding from central government through the Holy Cross school partnership which covers the Chorley area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools sport partnerships are groups of schools, working together to increase the quality and quantity of PE and school sport on offer to their pupils within and beyond the school day.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are currently 450 partnerships covering every maintained school in England. The Holy Cross partnership is managed from Holy Cross Catholic High School and administers the funding to the seven secondary schools and 40 primary schools within its boundaries.
     </p>
     <p>
      The table below shows the yearly grants made to the Holy Cross partnership between 2005 to 2010:
