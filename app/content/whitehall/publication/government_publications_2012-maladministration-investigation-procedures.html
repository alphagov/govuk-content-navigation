     <p>
      Under The Education (National Curriculum) (Key Stage 2 Assessment Arrangements) (England) Order 20031 (“the Order”), the Secretary of State has a statutory duty to investigate any matter brought to its attention relating to the accuracy, correctness or validity of results of any child’s National Curriculum, English writing sample and science sampling tests. Such matters are referred to in this document as ‘allegations of maladministration’.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term ‘maladministration’ refers to any act that could jeopardise the integrity, security or confidentiality of the key stage 2 level 3-5 national curriculum tests, the key stage 2 level 6 national curriculum tests, the key stage 2 English writing sample tests or the key stage 2 science sampling tests, and could lead to test results that do not reflect the unaided abilities of children. This could refer to a range of actions, including test papers being incorrectly opened, children cheating, over-aiding of children by test administrators or changes being made to children’s test scripts by someone other than the child.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this document is to outline procedures followed by STA when investigating allegations of maladministration and to provide information on: what constitutes maladministration; how allegations of maladministration are reported to STA; how a case of alleged maladministration will be investigated; and possible outcomes of an investigation into alleged maladministration.
