         Issues can sometimes occur during administration of the key stage 2 tests. Headteachers should brief their test administrators so that they can deal effectively with common situations. They should either be available in case test administrators need to ask their advice, or they should delegate responsibility to their test co-ordinator.
        </p>
        <p>
         This page gives guidance on dealing with common situations. Whatever action test administrators take, pupil safety must always be their first consideration.
        </p>
        <h2 id="when-to-stop-a-test">
         When to stop a test
        </h2>
        <p>
         Test administrators will need to stop the test either for an individual pupil or for the whole cohort if:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          test papers are incorrectly collated or the print is illegible
         </li>
         <li>
          an incorrect test has been administered
         </li>
         <li>
          a fire alarm goes off
         </li>
         <li>
          a pupil is unwell
         </li>
         <li>
          a pupil needs to leave the test room during the tests
         </li>
         <li>
          a pupil is caught cheating
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         If a test administrator needs to stop a test, it is important that they:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          make a note of the time
         </li>
         <li>
          make sure pupils are kept under test conditions and that they are supervised - if they have to leave the room, ensure they don’t talk about the test
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         If the test administrator is unclear about how to deal with the situation they should speak to you or the test co-ordinator for advice on what to do next. If they deal with an incident themselves they should brief you, a senior member of staff or the test co-ordinator on what happened and how they dealt with it once the test is over.
        </p>
        <h2 id="incorrectly-collated-test-papers-or-the-print-is-illegible">
         Incorrectly collated test papers or the print is illegible
        </h2>
        <p>
         The test administrator should stop the test for the affected pupils and make a note of the time. Tell the pupils that you will organise replacement papers.
        </p>
        <p>
         All schools receive additional copies of each test paper. If you don’t have enough, the headteacher should contact the
         <a href="#getting-help">
          national curriculum assessments helpline
         </a>
         for approval to make a photocopy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once the pupils have their replacement test papers, give them the remaining time to complete the test. Pupils must not be allowed to start the test again.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the end of the test, the replacement test paper must be inserted inside the original and packed with the rest of the test scripts.

          Instructions on packing test scripts

         An incorrect test has been administered
        </h2>
        <p>
         The test administrator should stop the test and keep the pupils under test conditions. You should contact the
         <a href="#getting-help">
          national curriculum assessments helpline
         </a>
         for advice.

        <h2 id="a-fire-alarm-goes-off">
         A fire alarm goes off
        </h2>
        <p>
         The test administrator should stop the test and note the time. They should evacuate the room following school procedures, telling the pupils to remain calm and silent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Supervise the pupils at all times to make sure they don’t talk about the test. Leave the test papers in the test room.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once it is safe to do so, pupils may continue with the test using the correct amount of remaining time.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the pupils do talk to each other about the test, you must call the
         <a href="#getting-help">
          national curriculum assessments helpline
         </a>
         for advice before you continue.
        </p>
        <h2 id="a-pupil-is-unwell">
         A pupil is unwell
        </h2>
        <p>
         The test administrator should stop the test for the individual pupil and note the time. After a rest break, if the pupil is well enough, give them the correct amount of remaining time to continue with the test. The test must be completed on the same day. If the pupil is too ill to continue the test, send the partially completed test script for marking.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the test script is spoiled, give the pupil a new test paper to complete the rest of the test. The test administrator should make a
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/key-stage-2-tests-guidance-for-test-administrators">
          transcript
         </a>
         by copying the answers from the spoiled test script on to the new test paper. Do this once the pupil has completed the test and under test conditions. Do not send the spoiled test script for marking.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the test script is unreadable, the test administrator should ask the pupil for their answers at the end of the test and record them in a different colour (black or blue) on the new test paper. Refer to the guidance on
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/key-stage-2-tests-guidance-for-test-administrators">
          creating a transcript
         </a>
         for instructions. The headteacher must submit an online notification form via the ‘Access arrangements’ section of the
         <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">
          NCA tools website
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         If other pupils have been disturbed, the test administrator may stop the test for all the pupils in the room. The administrator must make sure they note the time so that the rest of the pupils receive the correct amount of remaining time. If necessary, move the pupils to another room, ensuring they remain silent.
        </p>
        <h2 id="a-pupil-needs-to-leave-the-test-room-during-the-tests">
         A pupil needs to leave the test room during the tests
        </h2>
        <p>
         All pupils taking the tests must be supervised at all times. If a pupil needs to leave the test room the test administrator must make a note of the time and stop the test for the pupil. A test administrator should accompany the pupil when they leave the room. The pupil may continue with the test using the amount of time remaining to them.
        </p>
        <h2 id="a-mobile-phone-rings-or-a-pupil-is-found-to-be-using-one">
         A mobile phone rings or a pupil is found to be using one
        </h2>
        <p>
         Pupils must not have any items that may cause a disturbance during the tests.
        </p>
        <p>
         You may consider collecting mobile phones from pupils before the tests. 
If a mobile phone makes any sound, the test administrator must take it from the pupil. After the test, follow your school’s own behaviour and disciplinary procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the pupil has gained an advantage as a result of using the mobile phone, refer to the guidance about
         <a href="#pupil-cheating">
          pupils cheating
         </a>
         . If the pupil has gained no advantage, there is no need to contact us.
        </p>
        <h2 id="a-pupil-is-being-disruptive">
         A pupil is being disruptive
        </h2>
        <p>
         If a pupil’s behaviour is disturbing other pupils, the test administrator must stop the test, note the time and remove the pupil. You can decide whether the disruptive pupil should continue the test in a separate room. If the pupil doesn’t complete the test, their partially completed test script should be sent for marking.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other pupils should be given a few moments to refocus. They can then continue the test with the correct amount of remaining time.

        <h2 id="a-pupil-asks-for-additional-paper">
         A pupil asks for additional paper
        </h2>
        <p>
         The test papers and answer booklets have been designed so that most pupils will have enough room to record their answers. You may give a pupil lined paper if they need extra space to answer the English reading tests or the level 6 English grammar, punctuation and spelling test Paper 1: extended task. The pupil should write their name, and their school’s name and Department for Education number on any additional paper they use.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pupils must not be given spare paper for planning or working out answers to any other test.

        </h2>
        <p>
         The test administrator must stop the test and make a note of the time. They should tell the pupils to stay silent and remain seated.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should try to find a replacement CD player or find out when power should be restored. As a last resort, the test administrator should use the transcript included with the test papers to administer the rest of the test.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the administrator uses the transcript they must restart the test at the appropriate place. They should use a stopwatch, watch or a clock with a second hand to follow the timings for each question. You don’t need to submit the notification form to tell us that your school has used the transcript in these circumstances.

         A pupil is caught cheating

        <p id="pupil-cheating">
         The test administrator must record the details of the incident, including the pupil’s name, the name of the test and any specific questions in which the pupil was advantaged by cheating. If appropriate, they should move the pupil to another room for the remainder of the test.

         Submit a notification form

        <p>
         If you believe the pupil has gained an advantage, notify us by completing the online ‘notification of a pupil cheating form’ via the
         <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk" rel="external">
          NCA tools website
         </a>

         By completing the form, you agree to us either:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          removing marks for the specific questions where the pupil has gained an advantage
         </li>
         <li>
          annulling the pupil’s result in that test
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         A pupil must have a result for each component of a test to receive an overall test result. If 1 or more papers are annulled the pupil will not receive an overall test result.
        </p>
        <p>
         You will need to give the following information to complete the form:
        </p>

          the pupil’s name
         </li>
         <li>
          the name of the test
         </li>
         <li>
          whether you wish to annul the test paper or to remove marks from specific questions
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         If you choose to request the removal of marks you will also need to give the specific question numbers in which the pupil was advantaged by cheating.
        </p>
        <p>
         Collate the pupil’s test script(s) with the other pupils’ test scripts. Information about the incident should not be included with the test scripts.
