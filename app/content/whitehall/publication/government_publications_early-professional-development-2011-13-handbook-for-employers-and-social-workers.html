     <p>
      The former Children’s Workforce Development Council (CWDC) developed the Early Professional Development (EPD) programme for social workers who have completed the Newly Qualified Social Worker (NQSW) programme and are entering years two and three of employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      This programme is part of CWDC’s work with employers to support social workers as they progress in their career. It recognises that a social worker’s learning and development cannot end with initial qualification or with the successful completion of an induction year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The programme is flexible. It is designed to fit into organisations’ existing policies and procedures on supervision, assessment and appraisal. The EPD programme is not designed to confer a qualification or a status, but so that employers can implement it flexibly, in line with their local arrangements for training and development, and the needs of the social workers they employ.
