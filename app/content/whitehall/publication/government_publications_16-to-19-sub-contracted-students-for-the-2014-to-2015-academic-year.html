       The Education Funding Agency (EFA) started collecting information on sub-contracting from the 2014 to 2015 academic year for further education (FE) institutions, and from the 2015 to 2016 academic year for schools and academies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The EFA will publish this information on an annual basis, starting with FE institutions in 2016, and including schools and academies from 2017. This is the first of those publications.
      </p>
      <h2 id="scope-of-the-published-data">
       Scope of the published data
      </h2>
      <p>
       The analysis is based on the R14 return produced by FE institutions, the individualised learner record return for the end of the 2014 to 2015 academic year, which contains details on post-16 students, their characteristics and their learning aims for FE institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Student numbers are listed by funded institution and sub-contractor, and are split into students who are fully sub-contracted and those who are sub-contracted for part of their study programme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some students have parts of their study programmes partially sub-contracted to more than one sub-contractor, each instance of which is recorded as one sub-contracted student.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instances of total sub-contracted student numbers fewer than 5 are not shown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Data relating to sub-contracting in FE institutions was collected for the first time in the 2014 to 2015 academic year and is included in this publication. Equivalent data for schools and academies are being collected for the first time in the 2015 to 2016 academic year, and will be included in future publications.
