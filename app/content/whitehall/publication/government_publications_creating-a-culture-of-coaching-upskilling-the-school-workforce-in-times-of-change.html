      How a small cross-phase sample of 8 schools in one local authority area went about the process of creating a culture of coaching.
     </p>
     <p>
      The schools found that coaching needed careful introduction before being launched. Successful implementation was achieved when:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       clear links were made with existing initiatives such as Assessment for Learning and school self-evaluation
      </li>
      <li>
       coaching could be seen to supplement and improve existing contining professional development
      </li>
      <li>
       models of coaching are used to maintain focus
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Schools involved in this research were also working on ways to share the success of their coaching work, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       further collaborative working
      </li>
      <li>
       upskilling more staff in coaching skills
      </li>
      <li>
       sharing good practice with a wider audience
      </li>
     </ul>
