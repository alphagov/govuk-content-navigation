     <p>
      Most of the work relating to the development and introduction of the revised secondary curriculum was undertaken by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) under its remit from the former Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF). All the information set out in the table except for the support provided by CfBT has therefore been provided by the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA), which is the successor body to QCA.

       Where relevant, figures do not include any estimates for related QCA staff salaries, and staff IT equipment and related IT expenditure. It has not been possible to attribute a proportion of QCA staff costs to the revised secondary curriculum work as staff were employed across a range of other curriculum activity at the same time when the revised curriculum was developed.

       It has not been possible to estimate how much was spent on DCSF staff time in relation to the development of the new curriculum.
