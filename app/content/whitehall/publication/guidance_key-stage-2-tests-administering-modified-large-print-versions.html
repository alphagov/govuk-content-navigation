         The following general guidance will help you prepare for administering the key stage 2 tests. You should follow it to ensure that pupils using the modified large print (
         <abbr title="modified large print">
          MLP
         </abbr>
         ) versions of the tests can access them properly and that they are not at a disadvantage. You should use this guidance together with the:

          printed instructions that accompany the test papers
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         The printed instructions include information about what you should do before, during and after each test. Please follow them carefully in order to avoid accusations of maladministration. The instructions aren’t on GOV.UK because they contain information which must stay confidential until the test period is over.

         tests are automatically entitled to up to 100% additional time. Use your discretion about whether to use the full amount of additional time, for example with pupils who tire quickly. You should tell the pupils what time they are allowed, including any additional time, before each test starts.

        <p>
         Make sure all test scripts (answer booklets or test papers containing pupil’s answers) have the following information written on the front cover:

         <li>
          the name of the pupil, (this must be the same as the name entered in the ‘Pupil registration’ section of the

         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Any separate sheets should be labelled with the information listed above and inserted inside the relevant pupil’s test scripts. If these details have not been provided by the pupil, you should add them at the end of the test session.

         Mark scheme information boxes are printed on the back cover of the test papers to avoid confusion for pupils with a visual impairment. Tell pupils that they don’t need to write anything on the back cover of the paper.

        <p>
         The answer lines in the spelling task answer sheet are numbered to aid pupils with a visual impairment. You should use these numbers to help pupils to locate the correct line to write on, before reading aloud the sentence including the target spelling.

You may give pupils as much additional time as they need to familiarise themselves with any stimulus material before a test question is read. Once a question has been asked, you may allow pupils up to 100% additional time to process the language of the question and record their answer. The additional time is reflected in the modified script. You must adhere to the timings in the script strictly.

         The levels 3-5 and level 6 mathematics Paper 1 and Paper 2 contain a number of diagrams, graphs and pictures. Where necessary, we have simplified or adapted these for pupils with a visual impairment, but they might still need help locating the correct diagrams or clarifying their layout. Compared with the standard versions of the tests, some non-essential diagrams and illustrations may have been omitted from the
         <abbr title="modified large print">
          MLP
         </abbr>
         versions of the test papers. In the

         papers, diagrams are printed within the text.

         Pupils will need to draw in response to some questions. Where this is the case, pupils should use the method that they think is most appropriate. If appropriate, the area covered by the shape may be shaded or marked so that the marker can clearly read it.
