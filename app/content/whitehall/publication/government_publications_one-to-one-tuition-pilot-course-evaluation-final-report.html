      In 2009, the government introduced a national programme of one-to-one tuition for pupils who were falling behind in English and mathematics, to raise progression and attainment. One-to-one tuition was trialled in the Making Good Progress (MGP) pilots and funding was available nationally for over 600,000 places in 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, a report on the pilot which trialled one-to-one tuition in 10 local authorities identified challenges in recruiting sufficient teachers with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) to act as tutors. In response, the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) commissioned five experienced course providers to design and run one-to-one tuition pilot courses in various locations across England. The courses were designed to equip adults who already had relevant subject knowledge, but not QTS, to work as tutors in schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      The evaluation of the pilot courses had two components: implementation of the pilot courses and effectiveness of the course design, content, length and delivery in preparing participants to undertake tuition; impact of the subsequent tuition provided by course attendees on pupils.
