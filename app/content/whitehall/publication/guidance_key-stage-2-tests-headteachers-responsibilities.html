         Headteachers at schools which are taking part in the key stage 2 tests have specific responsibilities. These are described in the Introduction to the key stage 2
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/key-stage-2-assessment-and-reporting-arrangements-ara">
          ‘Assessment and reporting arrangements’
         </a>
         . This guidance explains how to fulfil your responsibilities in relation to the tests.

         Maladministration
        </h2>
        <p>
         Your school could be subject to investigations of maladministration if it doesn’t comply with our test administration guidance. This consists of:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          guidance on GOV.UK, including the
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/key-stage-2-assessment-and-reporting-arrangements-ara">
           ‘Assessment and reporting arrangements’
          </a>
          .
         </li>
         <li>
          information provided in the school stationery pack

          information provided with the test materials
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         You should consider taking steps to protect staff involved in administering the tests against allegations of maladministration. For example, you could invite a trusted member of your school’s community to
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/key-stage-2-tests-demonstrate-correct-test-administration">
          observe the tests
         </a>
         being administered at your school.
Allegations of maladministration can come from misunderstandings about correct test administration and use of access arrangements. To avoid this, make sure all staff, pupils and parents understand:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          how the tests will be administered
         </li>
         <li>
          what the test timetable is
         </li>
         <li>
          what assistance is allowed in the tests
         </li>
         <li>
          how any access arrangements will be used
         </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="test-administrators">
         Test administrators
        </h2>
        <p>
         Everyone involved in administering the tests must be thoroughly trained and familiar with the Standards and Testing Agency’s guidance. We suggest you hold training sessions for your test administration team. If you have arranged independent observation of the tests at your school, observers should also attend this training.
        </p>
        <p>
         Test administrators should be familiar with:

         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         You will need to think about how many staff will be needed to administer the tests. Anyone administering a test on their own is more vulnerable to allegations of maladministration as they don’t have another adult to verify the test administration procedures. 
We recommend having at least 2 test administrators in each test room. If this will be difficult for your school, you should consider using a
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/key-stage-2-tests-how-to-apply-for-a-timetable-variation">
          timetable variation
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         If a test administrator is a relative of a pupil they are supervising, there must be at least 1 other test administrator (not related to the pupil) present at all times.
        </p>
        <p>
         Arrangements should also be in place in case a pupil needs to be removed, eg if they are disruptive or become ill.

        <p>
         The pupil registration section of NCA tools remains open after Friday 20 March for the levels 3-5 tests. You should amend the data in this section to reflect any pupils that leave or join your school. You should do this up until the last day of test week.

          access arrangements

         , and understand how to use these correctly. We advise each test administrator is given a list of any pupils with access arrangements in advance of the tests.
        </p>
        <p>
         Relatives, carers or guardians of pupils who need access arrangements must not be involved in administering the tests to those pupils.
If you use access arrangements, you should consider whether to administer the tests to pupils in a separate room to the main group. 
Your school may receive a monitoring visit. If so, you will need to show evidence that:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          any access arrangements are based on normal classroom practice
         </li>
         <li>
          each pupil using access arrangements, eg a prompter, has an associated special educational need
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         You should also consider explaining to all parents and pupils what support can be given in the test. This should help to avoid any misinterpretation of valid access arrangements, which could lead to allegations of maladministration.
        </p>
        <p>
         Headteachers need to complete application or notification forms for certain access arrangements. Make sure you read the

        </p>
        <p>
         Store test materials in a secure locked cupboard. The tests should not be opened before they are administered unless the test paper needs to be modified or a translation needs to be made. In this instance they may be opened up to an hour before the administration of the tests. If more than an hour is required for any modification or translation then an application for early opening should have been made.

         You can only open test paper packs before the scheduled test date if we have given you permission. The deadline for applications was Monday 2 March.
        </p>
        <p>
         Test packs can be opened up to 1 hour before the start of a particular test but only if:

        <ul>
         <li>
          a written translation is needed for a mathematics test
         </li>
         <li>
          a test paper needs to be adapted to meet an individual pupil’s needs
         </li>

         Pupils may use highlighter pens to highlight sections of the reading booklet for their own reference, if this is normal classroom practice. Highlighted text must not form part of their response.
        </p>
        <p>
         All the key stage 2 tests will be marked on screen in 2015. Pupils must not use glitter pens or coloured pens, in particular red. These are illegible when scanned for

        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          a CD player
         </li>

         Additional paper

        <p>
         The test papers and answer booklets have been designed so that most pupils will have enough room to record their answers. If necessary pupils may be given spare lined paper for the English reading tests and the level 6 English grammar, punctuation and spelling test Paper 1: extended task. Spare paper must not be provided in any other test.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pupils taking the  level 6 English grammar, punctuation and spelling test Paper 1: extended task should ensure they have used the extra page in the back of the booklet before they use any additional paper. They should write their name, school name and Department for Education number on any additional paper they use. The

         Test rooms

         Think about how many rooms you will need to administer the tests, eg if you are using
         <a href="#access">
          access arrangements
         </a>
         you may need to separate specific pupils from the main group. 
Any rooms where tests will take place should be prepared before pupils are admitted. This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          removing or covering any displays or materials that could help pupils
         </li>
         <li>
          ensuring seating arrangements will allow all pupils to work quietly and independently
         </li>
         <li>
          making sure pupils won’t be able to view other pupils’ test papers
         </li>
         <li>
          ensuring a clock is visible in the room to help pupils pace themselves
         </li>
         <li>
          ensuring there is a board at the front of the room for test administrators to write start and finish times and other information

         In exceptional circumstances you may administer tests at a different location within the UK, eg another school, the pupil’s home, a hospital or pupil referral unit. You must still make sure the test administration guidance is followed correctly.

         Packing test scripts for marking
        </h2>
        <p>
         You are responsible for making sure your school’s test scripts are collated, packed and sealed correctly, as soon as possible on the day of each test. We advise you are personally involved in packing your school’s scripts. The
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/key-stage-2-attendance-register-and-test-script-dispatch">
          ‘Attendance register and test script dispatch instructions’
         </a>
         explains exactly how to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
         Any individual left alone with test materials is vulnerable to allegations of maladministration. Make sure that test scripts:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          are collected and collated by more than 1 person
         </li>
         <li>
          aren’t left with an individual at any point
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Your test administrators should return test scripts to you immediately after each test. Emphasise they must not review pupils’ answers, unless they are making a transcript. Test administrators should know which pupils are likely to need a transcript before the administration of the tests.
        </p>
        <p>
         You are responsible for ensuring that pupils’ answers are their own and that they are not amended after the tests.

         You must complete and submit the headteacher’s declaration form after your school has completed the tests. The form either confirms that you have administered the tests according to the published guidance or that you have raised issues with us.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
         The form includes instructions to help you complete it correctly. You will need to know the total number of pupils who sat the levels 3-5 and level 6 tests, including those who took braille versions. You can get this information from your test attendance registers.
        </p>
        <p>
         This year the form includes an additional question which asks whether you invited observers to oversee some or all of the tests.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where possible you need to confirm that the tests have been administered in accordance with the statutory requirements as set out in the 2015 key stage 2
