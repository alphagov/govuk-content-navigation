      Assessment objectives are part of the assessment arrangements for these qualifications. We will adopt the assessment objectives set out below into our regulatory framework through the subject-specific conditions that exam boards must comply with when designing their specifications.
     </p>
     <p>
      In early 2015 we will consult on proposed subject-specific conditions and guidance that will give effect to the assessment objectives set out in the attached document. In the meantime we are publishing them here so that they can be considered and understood alongside the subject content requirements and our decisions on assessment arrangements for these qualifications.
