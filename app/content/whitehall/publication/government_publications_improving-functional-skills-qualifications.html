      There are some skills that are fundamental: to be successful in life and at work, people must be able to read and write and to use numbers with confidence. People need these skills for a functioning society and a healthy economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once a person has these skills, this should be recognised by a qualification that allows them to progress into a job or go on to further study. That is what functional skills qualifications aim to do. They enable students to demonstrate real-life literacy, numeracy and IT skills through assessments set in everyday contexts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our review looked at level 2 functional skills English and mathematics qualifications. These are important ‘gateway’ qualifications, used in adult education, in apprenticeships and by young people who have not already secured grade C or above at GCSE.
     </p>
     <p>
      We concluded that aspects of the qualifications need to be improved. As a result, awarding organisations are making changes in four key areas: improving the quality of assessment materials, reducing the risk of malpractice and maladministration, strengthening standard setting procedures and evaluating better how far qualifications are meeting user needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      As awarding organisations make these improvements, functional skills qualifications should become more valid and more reliable: assessments will more effectively provide real-life contexts and will allow students to demonstrate greater breadth and depth of skills. The majority of improvements will be in place by this summer. We will carry out a follow up review in the autumn to check that the qualifications meet our regulatory requirements.
