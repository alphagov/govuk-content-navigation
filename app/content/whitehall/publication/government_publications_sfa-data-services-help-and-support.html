           Once you have sent in a query - whether by phone or by email - we will:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            send an email confirming your incident number and incident topic and if required, request further information

           <li>
            resolve at first line where possible - if not, escalate to an appropriate technical expert

           <li>
            send you an email with a resolution or an answer to your query

          <p>
           We are able to answer many issues very quickly, for example the resetting of passwords, or highlighting particular areas within our published documents for your action or information. More technical queries will take longer to answer.
          </p>
          <p>
           Please do not log multiple repeat enquiries by email as this will increase the amount of enquiries that need to be processed and will in turn slow overall response time.
