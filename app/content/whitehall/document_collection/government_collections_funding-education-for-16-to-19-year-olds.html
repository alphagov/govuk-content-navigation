      The Education Funding Agency funds education and training for 16 to 18 year olds through institutions  such as schools and academies with sixth-forms, Further Education institutions, Commercial and Charitable Providers (CCPs) and special schools. We also fund some private institutions such as those specialising in the arts such as dance and drama. Young people aged up to 25 who have a Education Health and Care Plan are funded as if they are aged 16 to 18.
     </p>

      This section explains how we calculate the funding, the rules you should follow in spending the funding, audit and other contractual requirements. There are details of our different student support funds, as well as information about specialist programmes that are currently running.
