      We are committed to making apprenticeships inclusive and accessible to all.
     </p>
     <p>
      A great deal has already been done towards this goal, but we know that barriers still remain, and that some groups remain under-represented or disadvantaged due to characteristics like their race, sex, disability, learning difficulty, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or belief.

      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-diversity-champions-network-communications-toolkit">
       toolkit
      </a>
      gives employer diversity champions information to engage and inspire communities and other employers to make apprenticeships more diverse. It includes statistics, tips and case studies with a particular focus on increasing the proportion of apprentices from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds.

      An
      <a href="http://www.employer-toolkit.org.uk/" rel="external">
       employer toolkit
      </a>
      is available to help employers support disabled apprentices.
     </p>
     <p>
      It demonstrates the simple and cost-effective actions to make apprenticeship programmes open to disabled apprentices, and the business benefits that follow. Developed by NIACE (the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education) with large and small employers from Alan Cooper Cabinetmaker Ltd to Tottenham Hotspur FC and Barclays, the toolkit includes six case studies, and informative and inspiring videos.
