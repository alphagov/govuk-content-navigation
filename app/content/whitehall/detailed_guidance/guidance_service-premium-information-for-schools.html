      The service premium is extra funding for schools to support children and young people with parents in the armed forces.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pupils attract the premium if they meet the following criteria:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       one of their parents is serving in the regular armed forces
      </li>
      <li>
       they have been registered as a ‘service child’ in the
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-census">
        school census
       </a>
       at any point since 2011
      </li>
      <li>
       one of their parents died while serving in the armed forces and the pupil receives a pension under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (
       <abbr title="Armed Forces Compensation Scheme">
        AFCS
       </abbr>
       ) or the War Pensions Scheme (
       <abbr title="War Pensions Scheme">
        WPS
       </abbr>
       )
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      In the financial year 2015 to 2016, schools will receive £300 for each eligible pupil.
