      Introduction
     </h2>
     <p>
      Academy trusts are independent charitable companies. They are also classified by the Office for National Statistics as central government public sector bodies. While academies are responsible for their own financial management, they are subject to public standards of accountability. The Department for Education, rather than the Charity Commission, is the principal regulator of academies and is responsible for overseeing their compliance with the financial accountability framework and with charity law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      ) oversees the arrangements that provide Parliament with assurance that academies operate to high standards of propriety and regularity. It aims to keep a reasonable balance between academy trusts’ independence and the need to account for public money, and it has worked with a
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-finance-and-assurance-steering-group-terms-of-reference">
       steering group
      </a>
      of academy trusts to achieve a position where the accountability requirements are satisfied while the administrative burden is minimised.
     </p>
     <p>
      The main components of the financial accountability framework and assurance arrangements are set out below.
     </p>
     <h2 id="who-this-guide-is-for">
      Who this guide is for
     </h2>
     <p>
      This guide is for academy trust accounting officers, finance staff and trustees. Auditors of academy trust accounts may also find it helpful.
     </p>
     <h2 id="the-academies-financial-handbook">
      The Academies Financial Handbook
     </h2>
     <p>
      The
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">
       Academies Financial Handbook
      </a>
      sets out the financial management, control and reporting requirements that apply to academy trusts. It describes a financial framework for trusts that focuses on principles rather than detailed guidance and reflects their accountability to Parliament and to the public.
     </p>
     <p>
      The handbook also describes the freedoms that trusts can exercise in their day-to-day business, the delegated financial authority levels that the Secretary of State for Education has given to them and the circumstances where trusts must seek the Secretary of State’s consent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compliance with the handbook is a condition of each trust’s funding agreement. The 2016 edition of the handbook comes into effect on 1 September 2016.
     </p>
     <h3 id="trading-with-connected-parties">
      Trading with connected parties
     </h3>
     <p>
      Section 3.2 of the handbook sets out the principles academy trusts must adopt when trading with connected parties. Additional guidance on charging for overheads is below:
     </p>
     <p>
      Overhead charges should be proportionate to the amount of work the supplier is doing for the trust. For example, if 10% of the connected supplier’s activity is for the trust, then that trust should pick up no more than 10% of the supplier’s total overheads. However, if at the end of the academy financial year, the charges for overheads recouped by the supplier exceed the total the supplier paid for overheads, the supplier should reduce the charges to the trust in the next academy financial year. This will ensure:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       that the trust is complying fully with the ’not for profit’ principles set out in the handbook by paying no more than the proportionate sum for the services received
      </li>
      <li>
       that the supplier is not drawing inadvertent profits
      </li>
     </ul>

      If you are joining an existing multi-academy trust which has previously prepared audited accounts and you plan to adopt the same financial management and governance arrangements, your accounting officer will need to confirm this on the online form.
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      will then seek assurance from the audited accounts received.
     </p>
     <p>
      You may appoint an auditor to assess compliance with mandatory financial management and governance requirements. The report will need to be sent to
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      within 4 months of the academy opening, and you should let

      The

       Academies Accounts Direction
      </a>
      is the reference pack for academy trusts and their auditors to use when preparing and auditing financial statements for the accounting period ending on 31 August annually. It supplements the Academies Financial Handbook. In producing the Accounts Direction,
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      takes requirements set out by the Charity Commission in its Statement Of Recommended Practice (
      <abbr title="Statement of Recommended Practice">
       SORP
      </abbr>
      ) and translates them into a form applicable to academy trusts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Accounts Direction outlines the requirements set out in academy trusts’ funding agreements with the Secretary of State where each academy trust must:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       prepare an annual report and financial statements to 31 August
      </li>
      <li>
       have these accounts audited annually by independent registered auditors
      </li>
      <li>
       produce a statement of regularity, propriety and compliance and obtain a regularity assurance report on this statement from the auditor
      </li>
      <li>
       submit the audited accounts and auditor’s regularity assurance report to the
       <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
        EFA
       </abbr>
       by 31 December
      </li>
      <li>
       file the accounts with the Companies Registrar as required under the Companies Act 2006
      </li>
      <li>
       publish the audited accounts on the trust’s website by 31 January
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Accounts Direction explains the elements you must include in your academy trust’s annual report and financial statements and the accounting treatments required. It also provides a model format for the report and the financial statements and ensures consistency of treatment between academy trusts.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the audited financial statements, you will be required to submit financial returns to
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">

       ensure anti-fraud and whistleblowing policies are in place and regularly update these and communicate them to staff

       conduct regular anti-fraud awareness training events for finance staff
