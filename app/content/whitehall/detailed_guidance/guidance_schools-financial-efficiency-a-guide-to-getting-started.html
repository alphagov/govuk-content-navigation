      The table below outlines a simple process schools may wish to use when looking to improve their financial efficiency, to help schools achieve a greater impact on pupil outcomes from their resources.

     <p>
      It sets out the different tasks involved and suggests which available tools and guidance could be used to support completion of each of these. It is not intended to be prescriptive, but rather an initial suggestion for schools to adapt and improve as they see fit.
