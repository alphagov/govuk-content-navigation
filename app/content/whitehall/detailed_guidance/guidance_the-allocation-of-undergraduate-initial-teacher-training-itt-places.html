     <p>
      For postgraduate courses, please read

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The criteria we will employ to allocate places between different courses is set out below. This includes a description of the different criteria we will consider. It does not describe the extent to which we will apply each criterion as we can only decide this once we have received all requests.
     </p>
     <p>
      The process and criteria described in this document will apply to the allocation of places for the 2016 to 2017 academic year. The National College for Teaching and Leadership (
      <abbr title="National College for Teaching and Leadership">
       NCTL
      </abbr>
      ), or any successor organisation, may modify or amend the approach it takes to allocate places in future years.

     <p>
      <abbr title="National College for Teaching and Leadership">
       NCTL
      </abbr>
      is responsible for managing bursary and grant funding associated with initial teacher training (
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      ) for postgraduate and undergraduate courses. It also monitors the public cost of student loans accessed by trainees on these.
     </p>
     <p>
      The approach we are taking to managing the allocation of places for undergraduate courses is different to that being operated for postgraduate provision this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      We expect to allocate a broadly similar number of places across all undergraduate courses as we did in 2015 to 2016 academic year. Funding constraints mean that we cannot allow unrestricted recruitment to undergraduate courses and we allocate fixed numbers of places to institutions at the start of each recruitment year in order to manage the process.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our approach to allocating places to these courses will not change for the 2016 to 2017 academic year. We will review requests against our identified criteria and allocate specific numbers accordingly.
     </p>
     <h3 id="physics-and-mathematics-places">
      Physics and mathematics places
     </h3>
     <p>
      We are keen to ensure that we recruit as many high-quality physics and mathematics trainees subjects as possible and will continue to allocate all eligible requests in these subjects. We will not allocate any physics or mathematics places to
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      providers graded “requires improvement” or “inadequate”.
     </p>
     <h3 id="opt-in-undergraduate-courses">
      Opt-in undergraduate courses
     </h3>
     <p>
      As part of our commitment to train and recruit more teachers for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (
      <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">
       STEM
      </abbr>
      ) subjects over the next 5 years, we are seed-funding the development of undergraduate opt-in courses leading to qualified teacher status (
      <abbr title="qualified teacher status">
       QTS
      </abbr>
      ), which enable students to incorporate the award of
      <abbr title="qualified teacher status">
       QTS
      </abbr>
      part way through their degree course, beginning in the 2016 to 2017 academic year. Providers in receipt of this funding are expected to bid for places through the allocations process, in line with the conditions of their grant funding agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      We are aware of interest from other providers to develop similar undergraduate degree courses. If you are intending to deliver the course from 2016 to 2017, you should also bid for places through this process. If you do so, we would encourage you to email the
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      recruitment team,
      <a href="mailto:itt.recruitment@education.gov.uk">
       itt.recruitment@education.gov.uk
      </a>
      , for details on the development of opt-in courses nationally.
     </p>
     <h3 id="primary-mathematics">
      Primary mathematics
     </h3>
     <p>
      We want to encourage other
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      providers to identify or develop courses that train generalist primary teachers with a substantial mathematics element included alongside other areas of the curriculum. Teachers trained on these courses will not have the same exclusive focus on mathematics as someone trained on a Primary mathematics specialist course but will have a robust grounding in the subject nonetheless. In particular, they will be capable of leading on mathematics in their school.
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      providers are therefore able to request places for “primary – general (with mathematics)”.
     </p>
     <h3 id="funding">
      Funding
     </h3>
     <p>
      We are unable to confirm which subjects will attract funding for the 2016 to 2017 academic year until October 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      A £9,000 bursary for final year undergraduates is available for trainees on courses in physics or mathematics that start in the 2015 to 2016 academic year and lead to qualified teacher status. The bursary is available to trainees who enrol on an undergraduate
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      course beginning that year, and is payable in the final year of their course.
     </p>
     <h2 id="teacher-supply-model">
      Teacher supply model
     </h2>
     <p>
      Each year, the Department estimates the number of trainees required using the teacher supply model. Following revision last year, the teacher supply model only identifies an estimate of the number of trainees needed for postgraduate courses. It does not produce an estimate of the number of trainees needed on undergraduate courses.
     </p>
     <p>
      The teacher supply model is updated to produce a new estimate for the number of trainees required each year. It treats undergraduate trainees as an input, rather than an output, because recruitment to these courses will not affect the stock of trained teachers for a number of years.

     <h2 id="allocation-methodology">
      Allocation methodology
     </h2>
     <p>
      We intend to allocate roughly the same number of undergraduate places as we did for the 2015 to 2016 academic year. We will allow growth in hard-to-fill subjects and strongly encourage providers to consider how they can develop their provision to produce attractive, high-quality programmes in these areas. Overall numbers will be based on the teacher supply model and so if the teacher supply model forecasts a continuing fall in demand for primary teachers, we may reduce the level of primary places to reflect this.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, it is likely that the volume of requests for places will exceed the number available for distribution. If this is the case, we will apply specific criteria to determine the requests we can grant, those we can only grant in part and those we have to reject.
     </p>
     <p>
      Limits on the number of places available will generally apply to both. The exceptions are eligible requests for mathematics and physics places, which we will allocate on request. Summaries of the 2 sets of criteria are provided below.
     </p>
     <h3 id="allocation-criteria">
      Allocation criteria
     </h3>
     <p>
      We will consider the following criteria if we choose to differentiate the allocation of places between universities, using allocations from the 2015 to 2016 academic year as our baseline for calculation.
     </p>
     <h3 id="subject">
      Subject
     </h3>
     <p>
      As identified above, we will prioritise requests for places in certain subjects above others in the allocation of places. In addition, while we want to support new courses in
      <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">
       STEM
      </abbr>
      subjects, we will place a limit on the number of places available for any course that did not run in the 2015 to 2016 academic year.
     </p>
     <h3 id="quality">
      Quality
     </h3>
     <p>
      As described above, we will use Ofsted inspection grades for overall effectiveness to determine the eligibility of a university to deliver
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      courses. In addition, we will consider using the latest available inspection grades published by Ofsted to differentiate the number of places allocated to
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      providers.
     </p>
     <p>
      We recognise that some
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      providers have been inspected under the current Ofsted framework and others have not. We appreciate that this means we may assess
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      providers across two different inspection frameworks for this criterion, but we believe this to be the fairest available assessment of an
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">

      provider’s quality.

       ITT
      </abbr>
      provider during the course of the year and awards them a higher grade, we will allow a review which may result in the allocation of additional places. Our consideration of a request for extra places will be informed by this methodology, but will also depend on other factors, including the latest allocation and recruitment position. There is no certainty of extra places being made available.

      provider receives a lower grade judgement at an inspection during the course of the year, we will not automatically review or alter their allocation. We will not reduce an allocation of places unless there is compelling evidence that demands the immediate cessation of training.
