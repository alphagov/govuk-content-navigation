       This guidance will be updated for the 2017 test cycle in February.

     <p>
      Schools must use the ‘Pupil registration’ section of the
      <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/Home.aspx" rel="external">
       NCA tools website
      </a>
      to register and confirm all pupils who are at the end of key stage 2 for the 2016 national curriculum tests.
     </p>
     <p>
      The deadline for registering pupils for the tests is Friday 18 March.
     </p>
     <p>
      This guidance gives advice to help you complete pupil registration correctly. There are specific instructions on NCA tools about:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       registering your pupils, including those working below the standards of the tests
      </li>
      <li>
       amending / updating pupils’ details, including the tests that they’ve been registered for
      </li>
      <li>
       adding / removing pupils
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="maintained-schools-including-special-schools-academies-and-prus">
      Maintained schools, including special schools, academies and PRUs
     </h2>
     <p>
      Make sure you understand the general requirements for all schools for registering pupils.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you submitted your school’s census data to the Department for Education (
      <abbr title="Department for Education">
       DfE
      </abbr>
      ) by the deadline your pupil list will have been uploaded to the ‘Confirm pupils’ page of NCA tools. You need to check that this data is still accurate, up to date and matches the information held within your management information system (
      <abbr title="management information system">
       MIS
      </abbr>
      ). If a pupil’s unique pupil number (UPN), name or date of birth are incorrect, you should change this in the ‘Pupil registration’ section of NCA tools. This is to make sure that when you submit teacher assessment data later in the test cycle it matches the data already held. It also ensures that when the results data is returned to your school it matches the data held in your
      <abbr title="management information system">
       MIS
      </abbr>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Your data will not be pre-populated if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       you are from a pupil referral unit (
       <abbr title="pupil referral unit">
        PRU
       </abbr>
       )
      </li>
      <li>
       you are from a non-maintained special school which didn’t place a test order by Friday 27 November (the test orders deadline)
      </li>
      <li>
       you missed the
       <abbr title="Department for Education">
        DfE
       </abbr>
       ’s census data deadline
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      You will need to upload you pupil data via the ‘Upload multiple pupils’ page of NCA tools.
     </p>
     <h2 id="independent-schools">
      Independent schools
     </h2>
     <p>
      You will only be able to register pupils for the tests if you ordered materials by Friday 27 November (the test orders deadline).
     </p>
     <p>
      You must complete ‘Pupil registration’ by Friday 18 March in order to participate in the 2016 key stage 2 tests. This is a strict deadline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Make sure you understand the general requirements for all schools for registering pupils. In addition, you will need to upload you pupil data via the ‘Upload multiple pupils’ page of NCA tools.
     </p>
     <p>
      If your school placed a test order but then opted out of the entire subject, the subject box will not be displayed. You can opt back in by either clicking on the ‘Pupils’ subject participation’ hyperlink on the ‘Confirm pupils’ page or selecting ‘Pupils’ subject participation’ from the left-hand menu. From that page you can re-select the subject.

     <h2 id="pupil-registration-requirements">

     </h2>
     <p>
      All schools must complete pupil registration for the key stage 2 tests. This means logging into NCA tools and:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       confirming that all pupils are registered and that each pupil’s details are complete and accurate
      </li>
      <li>
       indicating which pupils are working below the standard for 1 or more tests
      </li>
      <li>
       giving details of any pupils who are taking all of the tests in the future, have taken them in the past or have left the school
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Once you have checked all your details you must tick the confirmation box. If you make additional changes to your data you must reconfirm them.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ‘Pupil registration’ section of NCA tools does remain open after Friday 18 March. You should amend the data in this section to reflect any pupils that leave or join your school. You should do this up until Friday 13 May.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a pupil’s situation changes you should amend the attendance register to show this. Full instructions will be provided in the ‘Attendance register and test script dispatch instructions’. These will be in your school’s stationery pack.

      Registering pupils who are working below the standard of the tests
     </h3>
     <p>
      You should register all pupils who are eligible for the key stage 2 tests, even if they are working below the standard of the tests. Pupils who are working below the standard of the tests should be registered as ‘B’. For example, for the English tests, if a pupil can’t communicate in English they will be working below the standard of the tests and should be registered as ‘B’.

     <h3 id="registering-pupils-who-use-access-arrangements">

     </h3>
     <p>
      You should register pupils who use access arrangements for the tests.

     <h3 id="registering-pupils-with-english-as-an-additional-language">
      Registering pupils with English as an additional language
     </h3>
     <p>
      All pupils with English as an additional language (EAL) should be registered for the key stage 2 tests, regardless of whether they go on to take them.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the English tests, if a pupil can’t communicate in English they will be working below the standard of the tests and should be registered as ‘B’.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the mathematics tests, you may be able to make a

       translation
      </a>
      to enable the pupil to take part in the tests. The pupil should be registered as sitting the tests.
