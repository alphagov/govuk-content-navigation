      Schools must use the ‘Pupil registration’ section of NCA tools to register and confirm all of their pupils who will be entered for the 2017 national curriculum tests.

       The deadline for registering pupils for KS2 tests is Friday 17 March.

      This guidance will help you complete pupil registration correctly. Specific instructions are provided on NCA tools about:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       registering your pupils, including those working below the standard of the tests
      </li>
      <li>
       amending/updating pupils’ details, including the tests that they’ve been registered for

      Section 5.2 of the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2017-key-stage-2-assessment-and-reporting-arrangements-ara">
       2017 KS2 assessment and reporting arrangements (ARA)
      </a>
      includes general guidance on registering pupils for the tests.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you submitted your school’s census data to the Department for Education (DfE) by the deadline, your pupil list will have been uploaded to the ‘Confirm pupils’ page of NCA tools. You need to check that this data is still accurate, up to date and matches the information held within your management information system (MIS).
     </p>
     <p>
      If a pupil’s unique pupil number (UPN), name or date of birth is incorrect, you should change this in the ‘Pupil registration’ section of NCA tools. This is to make sure that when you submit teacher assessment data later in the test cycle, it matches the data already held. It also ensures that when we return results data to your school it matches the pupil data held in your MIS.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your data won’t be pre-populated if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       you are from a pupil referral unit (PRU)
      </li>
      <li>
       you are from a non-maintained special school which didn’t place a test order by Friday 25 November (the test orders deadline)
      </li>
      <li>
       you missed the DfE’s census data deadline
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      In these cases, you will need to upload your pupil data using the ‘Upload multiple pupils’ page of NCA tools.
     </p>
     <h2 id="independent-schools">
      Independent schools
     </h2>
     <p>
      You will only be able to register pupils for the tests if you ordered materials by Friday 25 November 2016 (the test orders deadline).
     </p>
     <p>
      You must complete ‘Pupil registration’ by Friday 17 March in order to participate in 2017 KS2 tests. This is a strict deadline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Make sure you understand the general requirements that apply to all schools when registering pupils. In addition, you will need to upload your pupil data using the ‘Upload multiple pupils’ page of NCA tools.
     </p>
     <p>
      If your school placed a test order but then opted out of an entire subject, the subject box will not be displayed. To opt back in:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       click on the ‘Pupils’ subject participation’ hyperlink on the ‘Confirm pupils’ page
      </li>
      <li>
       or select ‘Pupils’ subject participation’ from the left-hand menu, from where you can re-select the subject
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="pupil-registration-requirements">
      Pupil registration requirements
     </h2>
     <p>
      All schools must complete pupil registration for the KS2 tests. This means logging into NCA tools and:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       confirming that all pupils are registered and that each pupil’s details are complete and accurate
      </li>
      <li>
       indicating which pupils are working below the standard for one or more tests
      </li>
      <li>
       giving details of any pupils who are taking all of the tests in the future, have taken them in the past or have left the school
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Once you have checked your details you must tick the confirmation box. If you make additional changes to your data, you must reconfirm them.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ‘Pupil registration’ section of NCA tools remains open after Friday 17 March. You should amend the data in this section to reflect any pupils that leave or join your school after this date. You should do this up until the end of test week.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a pupil’s situation changes you should amend the attendance register to show this. Full instructions will be provided in the ‘Attendance register and test script dispatch instructions’. These will be in your school’s stationery pack and also available in March from the

      Registering pupils who are working below the standard of the tests
     </h2>
     <p>
      You should register all pupils who are eligible for KS2 tests, even if they are working below the standard of the tests. You should register these pupils as ‘B’. For example, if a pupil is unable to communicate in English, they will be working below the standard of the English tests and so should be registered as ‘B’.
     </p>
     <h2 id="registering-pupils-who-use-access-arrangements">
      Registering pupils who use access arrangements
     </h2>
     <p>
      You should register pupils who use access arrangements for the tests in the same way as pupils who aren’t using access arrangements.
     </p>
     <h2 id="registering-pupils-with-english-as-an-additional-language">
      Registering pupils with English as an additional language
     </h2>
     <p>
      All pupils with English as an additional language (EAL) should be registered for the KS2 tests, regardless of whether they go on to take them.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, if a pupil is working below the standard of the mathematics tests and is going to be assessed using the interim pre-key stage standards, they should be registered as ‘B’ for the tests.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the mathematics tests, you may be able to make a
