      The industry you work in will vary depending on the pathway you and your employer choose for the apprenticeship. In manufacturing you could be working on improving the performance of machinery and production technology to reduce environmental impact. In the construction sector you would be trained to advise on how to reduce the carbon footprint in the building trade.
     </p>
     <p>
      You’ll be taught about effective energy management systems to reduce energy consumption of plumbing, lighting and heating fixtures to help you work in building services engineering.
