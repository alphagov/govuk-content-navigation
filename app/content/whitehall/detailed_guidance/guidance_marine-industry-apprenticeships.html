      This apprenticeship covers several aspects of boat building:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       maintenance and repair
      </li>
      <li>
       marine engineering
      </li>
      <li>
       electrics and electronics
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="training-opportunities">
      Training opportunities
     </h2>
     <p>
      You could learn a variety of skills and techniques to build boats of all sizes and for all functions. You might use carpentry, electrical, plumbing and welding skills as well as more traditional maritime craft skills like rigging and sailmaking.
     </p>
     <p>
      The work could involve constructing frameworks, hulls and decks – even installing parts such as engines, propellers and steering systems.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most apprentices will work under the supervision of others and undertake tasks such as boat handling, support, repair, and outfitting.
     </p>
     <p>
      You’ll be working as craftspeople and taking up more complex work without direct supervision on the advanced apprenticeship.
