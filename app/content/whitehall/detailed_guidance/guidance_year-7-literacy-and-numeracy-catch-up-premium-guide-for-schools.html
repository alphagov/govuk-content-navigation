      How to use your year 7 literacy and numeracy catch-up premium
     </h2>
     <p>
      You should identify pupils who need extra support from the year 7 catch-up premium, so you can decide the best way to use the funding. You should only select programmes and approaches that you know are effective.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, you could use the funding to pay for:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       individual tuition
      </li>
      <li>
       intensive small-group tuition
      </li>
      <li>
       external services and materials
      </li>
      <li>
       summer schools that help students catch up over a short period of time
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      You can find examples of effective approaches and programmes in our summary of
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/literacy-and-numeracy-catch-up-strategies">
       research into literacy and numeracy catch-up strategies
