        <p>
         A small number of pupils may need additional arrangements so they can take part in the KS2 tests. Headteachers and teachers must consider whether any of their pupils will need access arrangements before they administer the tests.
        </p>
        <p>
         Access arrangements should be based primarily on normal classroom practice for pupils with particular needs. They must never provide an unfair advantage. The support given must not change the test questions and the answers must be the pupils’ own.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have produced some

         Some access arrangements must be applied for in advance:

        </p>
        <p>
         Due to the diversity of pupils’ needs this guidance doesn’t list every circumstance where it would be appropriate to use access arrangements. When planning for the tests you should think of any needs your pupils may have and whether they receive additional support as part of normal classroom practice. Some pupils may not be able to access the tests, despite the provision of the additional arrangements.

         If this guidance doesn’t cover a pupil’s needs, you should contact us.

         </p>
        </div>
        <p>
         Maintained schools, including academies and free schools, need to provide pupils’ UPNs when completing applications. Independent schools do not need to provide a pupil UPN.
        </p>
        <p>
         Applications should be made by a teacher who has a good knowledge of the particular pupil’s needs and abilities. Applications are determined by the teacher’s responses to the application questions. Reports from educational psychologists or other education professionals are not required.  This is because additional time should be based primarily on normal classroom practice and might apply to pupils that do not hold such a report. Where a report is already in place, teachers might choose to use them to inform their responses about the pupil.
        </p>
        <p>
         Applications can’t be amended. You should read the

         before starting to make an application. This will ensure that you understand what information is needed to complete the application process.
        </p>
        <p>
         You will need to respond to 7 questions about the pupil. The questions draw on your knowledge of the pupil and your ability to assess an individual pupil and their particular abilities or needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         All questions should be answered before submitting the form. On completion of the application you will be given information about the use of additional time and/or any alternative access arrangements for the pupil, based on your responses to the questions.
        </p>
        <p>
         If additional time has not been awarded it is because the pupil does not meet the criteria for additional time. In these circumstances, you may wish to consider alternative access arrangements for the pupil. Advice on this will be given on the application outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
         Schools must have evidence to justify their decisions regarding the use of additional time in case they receive a monitoring visit.
        </p>
        <p>
         Local authorities (LAs) do not consider applications for additional time, although they will be able to view schools’ completed applications. Schools that use additional time or any other access arrangement inappropriately will be subject to a maladministration investigation. This could lead to pupils’ results being amended or annulled.

         Compensatory marks may be awarded to pupils who have a profound hearing impairment and do not use lip-reading or a signing system. They are available for the spelling component of the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test.
        </p>
        <p>
         Compensatory marks are based on the average raw score achieved by the pupils who participated in the pre-testing phase of the test’s development. Awarding compensatory marks allows pupils to receive a test outcome for the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a pupil takes the spelling test, when compensatory marks have been approved, the pupil will be awarded marks based on their performance in the test. They will not be awarded the compensatory marks.

         Schools may open test papers, including modified test papers, up to 1 hour before a test is due to start without seeking permission from STA. This flexibility is designed to help schools that need to make small adaptations for their pupils, eg photocopying test papers onto coloured paper.

        <p>
         If you need to open test papers, including modified test papers, more than 1 hour before a test is due to start you must submit an application for early opening. Permission is required in all cases, regardless of a pupil’s provision as determined in the Special educational needs (

         Applications made after the deadline of Monday 29 February will only be considered under exceptional circumstances. Examples of exceptional circumstances for an application to be considered after the application deadline are where a pupil’s needs have changed or a pupil arrives at the school after 29 February. In such cases you should contact STA using the ‘Message us’ system in the NCA tools website to discuss the pupil’s requirements.

         A scribe is a writing assistant who writes out answers dictated by the pupil.{:#scribe}
Schools should consider using a word processor or transcription before deciding to use a scribe. A scribe should only be used if other options are not appropriate and if it is part of normal classroom practice for that pupil. Schools must have evidence to show that resources are routinely used to support the pupil (except in the case of injuries).
        </p>
        <p>
         A scribe can be used when a pupil is physically:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          unable to write their own answers or use a word processor
         </li>
         <li>
          able to write but has a motor impairment that causes physical discomfort when writing
         </li>
         <li>
          able to write but writes very slowly
         </li>
         <li>
          able to write but finds writing very difficult
         </li>
         <li>
          unable to write following an injury
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Schools should arrange for a scribe in advance when they are aware of a pupil who may need a scribe part way through the test. A scribe might be needed for a pupil:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          who is known to experience fatigue
         </li>
         <li>
          with a visual / motor impairment and writes over their own handwriting which needs to be made clear
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         In these circumstances the pupil may start the test as normal and begin using a scribe when needed.

        </ul>
        <p>
         The scribe must not pause for spellings to be dictated unless the pupil usually works this way. Pausing is allowed in the spelling component of the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test. All language, punctuation and phrasing must be the pupil’s own.
        </p>
        <p>
         The scribe must:

          not transcribe a braille script to print
         </li>

         </li>
         <li>
          work at the pupil’s pace and not hurry them if they need time for reflection / rest or reading
         </li>
         <li>
          follow precisely the pupil’s instructions to draw or add to diagrams / charts and graphs in the mathematics tests

         Schools should consider testing pupils in a separate room if they need more than single words or sentences read to them. For example a pupil’s individual education plan may show that they need the whole question paper read to them so that they can access the test.

         Pupils with injuries who take the tests do not qualify for special consideration as alternative access arrangements are available.

         Pupils who are ill at the time of the tests
        </h2>
        <p>
         Pupils who are ill on the day of a test should not sit them. Schools should consider using a timetable variation  if it is a minor illness and a pupil is not able to take the test on the published test date.
Pupils who were ill but still took the test do not qualify for special consideration as they shouldn’t have taken the test if they were unwell.
