      Introduction
     </h2>
     <p>
      Some pupils with specific needs may need additional arrangements to be put in place so that they can take part in the key stage 2 (KS2) tests. Access arrangements are adjustments that can be made to support pupils. Headteachers and teachers must consider whether any of their pupils will need access arrangements before they administer the tests.
     </p>
     <p>
      Access arrangements should be based primarily on normal classroom practice and they must never provide an unfair advantage. The support given must not change the test questions and the answers must be the pupils’ own.
     </p>
     <p>
      Failure to apply for, or administer, access arrangements appropriately could result in a maladministration investigation at the school and the pupil’s results may be annulled.
     </p>
     <p>
      It may be helpful to use KS2
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum-assessments-practice-materials">
       practice materials
      </a>
      with pupils before administering the tests. This will enable you to identify where support is needed and if any adaptations will need to be made, to either the test materials or the administration of the tests.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 5.3 of the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2017-key-stage-2-assessment-and-reporting-arrangements-ara">
       2017 KS2 assessment and reporting arrangements (ARA)
      </a>
      provides a summary of who access arrangements are for and how they can be used.
     </p>
     <p>
      Access arrangements might be used to support pupils:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       who have difficulty reading
      </li>
      <li>
       who have difficulty writing
      </li>
      <li>
       with a hearing impairment
      </li>
      <li>
       with a visual impairment
      </li>
      <li>
       who use sign language
      </li>
      <li>
       who have difficulty concentrating
      </li>
      <li>
       who have processing difficulties
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Due to the diversity of pupils’ needs, this guidance does not list every circumstance where it would be appropriate to use access arrangements. When planning for the tests, you should think of any needs your pupils have and whether they receive additional support as part of normal classroom practice. Some pupils may not be able to access the tests, despite the provision of additional arrangements.
     </p>
     <p>
      During a monitoring visit, local authorities (LAs) may ask to see evidence that any additional support provided in the tests is part of normal classroom practice. Evidence will vary according to the type of arrangement and the tasks it is required for. Evidence may include notes recorded in teaching plans, individual pupil support plans or a pupil’s classwork to demonstrate the type of support provided in the classroom.
     </p>
     <p>
      If this guidance does not cover a particular pupil’s needs, you may contact STA using ‘Message us’ in the ‘Access arrangements’ section of
      <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/Home.aspx" rel="external">
       NCA tools
      </a>

      Schools may open test papers, including modified test papers, up to one hour before a test is due to start without seeking permission from STA. This flexibility is designed to help schools that need to make small adaptations for their pupils, for example, photocopying test papers onto coloured paper.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you need to open test papers, including modified test papers, more than one hour before a test is due to start you must submit an application for early opening. Permission is required in all cases, regardless of a pupil’s provision as determined in the
      <abbr id="contact" title="Special educational needs">
       SEN
      </abbr>
      code of practice.
     </p>
     <p>
      We will only allow schools to open standard test materials more than one day before the tests, or modified materials more than 2 days before the tests, in exceptional circumstances. Justification must be provided with the early opening application.

     </p>
     <p>
      Applications made after the deadline of Monday 27 February will only be considered under exceptional circumstances. Examples of exceptional circumstances are where a pupil’s needs have changed or a pupil joins the school after 27 February 2017. In such cases, you should contact STA using ‘Message us’ in the ‘Access arrangements’ section of

      Schools will only be given permission to open test materials early if they need to prepare apparatus or make adaptations to a test. Early opening may be appropriate when:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       preparations need to be made to use
       <abbr title="modified large print">
        MLP
       </abbr>
       or braille versions of the tests, such as setting up visual scanning equipment or preparing tactile examples
      </li>
      <li>
       some, or all, of a test paper needs to be enlarged to a particular font size for a pupil with a visual impairment or specific special educational need
      </li>
      <li>
       communicators or sign language interpreters need to co-ordinate the presentation of a test to a large number of pupils with a hearing impairment and / or pupils who use sign language

      Maintained schools, including academies and free schools, need to provide unique pupil numbers (UPNs) when completing applications. Independent schools do not need to provide pupils’ UPNs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Applications should be made by a teacher who has a good knowledge of the particular pupil’s needs and abilities. The outcomes of applications are determined only by the teacher’s responses to the questions. Reports from educational psychologists or other education professionals are not required. This is because additional time should be based primarily on normal classroom practice and might apply to pupils that do not hold such a report. Where a report is already in place, teachers might choose to use it to inform their responses about the pupil.

      before starting to make an application. This will ensure that you understand what information is required to complete the application process.
     </p>
     <p>
      You will need to respond to 7 questions about the pupil. The questions draw on your knowledge of the pupil and your assessment of their particular abilities or needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Answer all questions before submitting the form. On completing the application, you will be given information about the use of additional time and / or any alternative access arrangements for the pupil, based on your responses to the questions.
     </p>
     <p>
      If additional time has not been awarded, it is because the pupil does not meet the criteria. In these circumstances, you may wish to consider alternative access arrangements for the pupil. Advice on this will be provided in the application outcome.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools must have evidence to justify their decisions regarding the use of additional time in case they receive a monitoring visit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Additional time is not cumulative. If a pupil qualifies for additional time for more than one reason on the application form, they are only allowed 25% additional time. However, a pupil that qualifies for additional time for 2 reasons may be allowed the use of an aid as well as 25% additional time. For example, a pupil that is a slow reader and also a slow writer could use a scribe for writing and still qualify for 25% additional time if they are reading independently.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local authorities (LAs) do not make decisions about applications for additional time, although they will be able to view schools’ completed applications. Schools that use additional time or any other access arrangement inappropriately will be subject to a maladministration investigation. This could lead to pupils’ results being amended or annulled.

      Compensatory marks may be awarded to pupils who have a profound hearing impairment and do not use lip-reading or a signing system. They are available for the spelling paper of the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compensatory marks are based on the average raw score achieved by pupils who take the test. Awarding compensatory marks allows pupils to receive an overall test outcome for the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test.
     </p>
     <p>
      A pupil should not take the spelling paper of the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test if they have been awarded compensatory marks. If a pupil incorrectly takes the spelling paper when compensatory marks have already been approved, they will be awarded marks based on their performance in that test and will not be awarded the compensatory marks.

      A scribe is a writing assistant who writes out answers dictated by the pupil.

     <p>
      Schools should consider using a word processor or transcription before deciding to use a scribe. A scribe should only be used if other options are not appropriate and if it is part of normal classroom practice for that pupil. Schools must have evidence to show that resources are routinely used to support the pupil, except in the case of injuries.

      A scribe can be used when a pupil is physically:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       unable to write their own answers or use a word processor
      </li>
      <li>
       able to write but has a motor impairment that causes physical discomfort when writing
      </li>
      <li>
       able to write but writes very slowly

      <li>
       able to write but finds writing very difficult
      </li>
      <li>
       unable to write following an injury
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Schools should arrange for a scribe in advance when they are aware of a pupil who may need a scribe part way through the test. A scribe might be needed for a pupil:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       who is known to experience fatigue
      </li>
      <li>
       with a visual or motor impairment and writes over their own handwriting which needs to be made clear
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      In these circumstances, the pupil may start the test as normal and begin using a scribe when needed.
     </p>
     <h3 id="guidance-for-scribes">

     <p>
      Scribes:

      <li>

      <li>
       must not be another pupil at the school or a relative, carer or guardian of the pupil
      </li>
      <li>
       should have a working knowledge of the subject
      </li>
      <li>
       may also act as a reader (for the English grammar, punctuation and spelling and / or mathematics tests only)
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The scribe must not pause for spellings to be dictated unless the pupil usually works this way. Pausing is allowed in the spelling paper of the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test. All language, punctuation and phrasing must be the pupil’s own.
     </p>
     <p>
      The scribe must:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       not transcribe a braille script to print
      </li>
      <li>
       make a correction on a typescript or braille script if asked to do so by the pupil
      </li>
      <li>
       work at the pupil’s pace and not hurry them if they need time for reflection, rest or reading
      </li>
      <li>
       follow the pupil’s instructions precisely to draw or add to diagrams, charts and graphs in the mathematics tests
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If a pupil needs a scribe because of an injury that occurred in the week before the tests, schools may allow 25% additional time as well as the use of the scribe. This is only for circumstances where the pupil is unfamiliar with working with a scribe. Schools do not need to apply for additional time in this instance but should be prepared to explain the arrangement in the event of a monitoring visit.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a pupil uses a scribe when they have already been awarded additional time due to reduced writing speed, then the original additional time application will no longer apply.

In most cases, this will apply to pupils whose reading age is considerably lower than their actual age.
      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      Readers are usually teachers or support assistants, they:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       don’t need to be specialists in the subject being tested
      </li>
      <li>
       should be able to read accurately and at a reasonable speed
      </li>
      <li>
       must not be another pupil at the school or a relative, carer or guardian of the pupil
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Before the test period, readers must understand:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the test format and style
      </li>
      <li>
       their role and what may or may not be read to a pupil in particular tests
      </li>
      <li>
       any subject-specific issues that might occur
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Schools should consider testing pupils in a separate room if they need more than single words or sentences read to them. For example, a pupil’s individual education plan may show that they need the whole question paper read to them so that they can access the test.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a pupil requests it, the reader may also read back any part of a pupil’s response.
     </p>
     <h3 id="eligibility-1">

     <p>
      Readers must not be used with pupils who are capable of reading the test materials on their own. STA will monitor schools during the test period to make sure readers are used correctly. The inappropriate use of readers may lead to the annulment of a pupil’s results.
     </p>
     <h3 id="english-reading-tests">
      English reading tests
     </h3>
     <p>
      As the English reading test is designed to allow pupils to demonstrate reading skills as well as comprehension, readers may only help pupils to read the general instructions. This includes information on the front cover of the test paper and any directions that are not part of the actual questions. For example, the reader may say ‘Questions 1–12 are about The Humble Potato (pages 4–5)’, but the reader must not read the texts, questions or any part of a pupil’s response back to the pupil.
     </p>
     <h3 id="english-grammar-punctuation-and-spelling-tests">
      English grammar, punctuation and spelling tests
     </h3>
     <p>
      Readers are allowed for the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test if it is part of normal classroom practice. ‘Notes for readers in the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test’ will give examples of how particular types of questions should be read aloud to a pupil. Readers should make sure they understand the guidance so that they read each question type correctly, in particular questions with multiple choice answers. This is so they do not give pupils an unfair advantage by reading questions in a particular way.
     </p>
     <h3 id="mathematics-tests">
      Mathematics tests
     </h3>
     <p>
      A reader may help a pupil to read the mathematics tests. They may:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       clarify instructions, as long as no additional information is given which could invalidate the test
      </li>
      <li>
       read but not clarify subject-specific vocabulary
      </li>
      <li>
       refer a pupil back to the previous part of the question in multi-part questions
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If a mathematics question is read to a pupil the reader may read words and numbers but not mathematical symbols. This is so that the function of a mathematical symbol is not inadvertently explained by reading its name.

      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      A pupil with severe attention problems may be supported by a prompter. Verbal prompting may be used where this is in line with the support the pupil normally receives in class.
     </p>

      Schools do not need to request permission from STA or their
      <abbr title="local authority">

      </abbr>
      to use a prompter.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, in the event of a monitoring visit schools must:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       have evidence to show that each pupil using a prompter has severe attention problems
      </li>
      <li>
       be able to show that resources are routinely committed to providing this support
      </li>

      <li>
       be the pupil’s own learning support assistant
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Prompters must:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       only be used on a one-to-one basis
      </li>
      <li>
       only be used to draw a pupil’s attention back to the task
      </li>
      <li>
       not advise the pupil on which questions to do or when to move on to the next question
      </li>
      <li>
       not help the pupil on the order they should attempt the questions
      </li>
      <li>
       be careful not to do anything that could be interpreted as over-aiding pupils, as this could lead to allegations of maladministration
      </li>
      <li>
       not be another pupil at the school or a relative, carer or guardian of the pupil
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If a pupil finds it difficult to concentrate on individual questions, then schools may choose to use adhesive notes or stickers to cover other questions on the page. In these circumstances, the whole question the pupil is currently working on should remain uncovered. This should only be done when it is in line with the support the pupil normally receives in class.

      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      The majority of pupils should be able to complete the tests without a break. However, rest breaks can be appropriate for a pupil who finds it difficult to concentrate or who may experience fatigue.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rest breaks can be provided by splitting the tests into sections or stopping the clock. The content of the test must not be discussed during rest breaks. The test must be completed on the same day that it was started.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rest breaks can be used at any point during the English reading test. However, you might consider stopping the test once the pupil has either read a particular text or answered the questions for that text, before moving onto the next text in the test.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is no specific guidance for using rest breaks in the mathematics or the English grammar, punctuation and spelling tests.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you decide to split a test, you should:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       divide the test into sections during the hour before it is due to start
      </li>
      <li>
       administer all sections of the test on the timetabled day
      </li>
      <li>
       make sure the pupil has the same overall time to complete the test as those who take the test in one sitting
      </li>
      <li>
       keep the questions in the same order
      </li>
      <li>
       give the pupil an opportunity to attempt all parts of a paper, so that the test properly reflects their attainment
      </li>

      If the clock is stopped for a pupil to take a rest break, you must make sure that you do not give any unauthorised additional time.

      Written translations should be made during the hour before the test is due to start. If, due to exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to do this, an application for early opening of the test materials must be made.

     <p>
      Oral translations may be given by a translator at the time of the tests. This must be on a one-to-one basis. If a pupil answers orally this must also be on a one-to-one basis. If several pupils require a translator but only one is available, you should make a notification of start time variation to stagger the time that pupils take the test or apply for a timetable variation to administer the test on a different day.
     </p>

      The pupil may then write their responses in English or in their first language. If the pupil’s answers are not in English, a transcript should be made by the pupil’s usual translator.

     <h3 id="notes-for-translators">
      Notes for translators
     </h3>
     <p>
      Translators need to bear in mind that pupils with English as an additional language may not be familiar with some subject-specific vocabulary and technical terms in their preferred language.
     </p>
     <p>
      A translator must not be another pupil at the school or a relative, carer or guardian of the pupil requiring a translation. Inappropriate use of translators may lead to a maladministration investigation and annulment of the pupil’s results.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the English reading and the English grammar, punctuation and spelling tests, only the general instructions on the cover of the question papers and any directions that are not part of the actual questions can be translated. No help may be given with reading or understanding the questions or passages of text on which questions are based.

      In the event that a pupil sustains an injury within a week of the tests which affects their ability to take a test, for example, if they break their writing arm or hand, you can provide them with additional support. This could include a scribe or use of a word processor. Where the pupil is not familiar with any additional support provided, they may also be allowed 25% additional time for the test.

      At the end of each test, test administrators should make a note of which pupils used a scribe, transcript, or word processor or electronic or technical aid and give the information to their headteacher.

     <p>
      If a pupil sustains an injury more than a week before the tests you can provide them with a scribe, a word processor or make a transcript of their test paper but they are not allowed additional time. You should give the pupil the chance to practice with a scribe or word processor under test conditions before test week starts.
Pupils with injuries who take the tests do not qualify for special consideration, as alternative access arrangements are available.
