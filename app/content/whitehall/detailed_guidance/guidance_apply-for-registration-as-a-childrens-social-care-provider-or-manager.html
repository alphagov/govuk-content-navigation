     </p>
     <p>
      If you send your application in the post, you must include a completed fees form and a cheque for the relevant fee made payable to ‘Ofsted’. Please make sure you have signed and dated the cheque. Ofsted will return any application that does not come with the relevant fee.

      Assessment process
     </h2>
     <p>
      When Ofsted gets your application we will process it referring to the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-care-registration-handbook">
       ‘Social care registration handbook’
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      We carry out checks and get references for each person connected with your application to make sure they are suitable to work with children and have the necessary skills, knowledge and experience. Applicants also have to demonstrate that they meet the relevant requirements of registration. As part of our assessment processes we visit the premises and carry out interviews.
     </p>
     <h3 id="visit-to-your-establishment-or-agency">
      Visit to your establishment or agency
     </h3>
     <p>
      During the visit we assess the premises and services you intend to provide, and interview all those connected with the application. In some cases it may be necessary to make more than one visit during the registration process if several people need to be interviewed. The inspector uses the visit to assess:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       whether the proposed services protect and promote children, young people and adult service users’ safety and welfare
      </li>
      <li>
       your fitness to provide or manage an establishment or agency
      </li>
      <li>
       whether the proposed premises are safe and suitable for the purposes intended in the application (please note, this does not apply to residential holiday schemes for disabled children)
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      At the end of the visit the inspector will:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       set out any actions you must take before we can make a final decision about your application
      </li>
      <li>
       usually tell you whether he or she proposes to recommend that we grant or refuse registration
      </li>
      <li>
       tell you if he or she needs to take further advice, receive additional information or complete outstanding checks
      </li>
      <li>
       discuss any conditions of registration that you have requested or confirm that no conditions of registration are necessary
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Once we have all the information from the visit and checks, we make a decision about whether to register you to operate or  refuse your application. You cannot start to operate an establishment or agency until you have a certificate of registration.
     </p>
     <p>
      Timescales are shown in our
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-registration-for-childrens-social-care-services">
       guide to registration for children’s social care services
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Applications are not subject to tacit approval (where if an authority does not process an application within the published timescales, then the application is granted by default). There are overriding reasons for this relating to the public interest, namely the need to safeguard and protect children’s welfare (Provision of Services Regulations 2009, regulations 19(5) and (6).
     </p>
     <p>
      We aim to carry out our work smoothly and without incident. However, if you are dissatisfied with any aspect of the registration process please contact us. See our

     <p>
      If we grant your application for registration, we will send you your certificate of registration.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is important to note that you cannot begin to work as a children’s social care provider until you have your certificate. You cannot start just because you know that we have agreed to register you.
     </p>
     <p>
      You must display the certificate where people can see it.
     </p>
     <p>
      If something happens to your certificate, you will need to get a replacement. Please call us on 0300 123 1231 if you need a replacement certificate.
