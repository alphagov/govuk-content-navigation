      Early years providers are any organisation that offers education for children aged under 5, including nurseries and childminders.

      Funding for 2015 to 2016

     <p>
      The amount of funding you receive in 2015 to 2016 depends on how many eligible 2-year-olds take up their entitlement to early education in your area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Details of how we’ll calculate and adjust the amount of funding each local authority receives are available in the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2015-to-2016">

      We’ve provided
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-education-entitlement-for-2-year-olds-hourly-rates">
       a breakdown of the hourly rates
      </a>
      we’ll use to decide how much funding each local authority will receive in 2015 to 2016 as part of the

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      You can use these rates for reference until we allocate you your funding in June 2015.

     <h2 id="how-to-manage-the-funding">
      How to manage the funding
     </h2>
     <p>
      We recommend that you pass as much funding as possible to early years providers in your area.
     </p>
     <p>
      You must consult your area’s school forum every year on the arrangements for funding early years provision. You should set the hourly rates you’ll pay providers for the early education entitlement for eligible 2-year-olds as part of this consultation.
