  Effective maintenance of school buildings to support the delivery of education

      The government will invest £4 billion to fund condition improvement and maintenance in our schools between 2015 and 2018. This investment will help us ensure that children can learn in the best environment possible, helping them to achieve their full potential.
     </p>
     <p>
      School buildings have the potential to enhance the delivery of education, but can also provide a significant distraction for staff and pupils when things go wrong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Effective maintenance reduces the risks associated with buildings and building services, and helps to prevent the need for significant capital expenditure and disruption which can follow building failure.
     </p>
     <p>
      To provide additional support, we have produced a note that gives advice on a range of subjects including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Understanding your estate
      </li>
      <li>
       Maintaining your buildings
      </li>
      <li>
       Dealing with emergencies
      </li>
      <li>
       Procuring and managing works
      </li>
      <li>
       Maintenance checks and testing
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The note is aimed at all those with responsibilities for maintaining school buildings, including head teachers, business managers and facilities managers.
