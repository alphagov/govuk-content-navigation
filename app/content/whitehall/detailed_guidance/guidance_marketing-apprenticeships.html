      Marketing is a creative industry that is essential to commercial success. It is concerned with finding the needs and wants of people, developing a product or service that meets that need and helping create a desire for what has been created.

      Marketing involves several specialisms including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       direct marketing communicating directly with the consumer via mailings, emails or telephone calls)
      </li>
      <li>
       market research (gathering and analysing information on customers, competitors and the market)
      </li>
      <li>
       public relations (the public image of your product or organisation).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Within the apprenticeship, the nature of the work will depend on your employer. However you are likely to be working as a marketing or market research assistant/ executive or perhaps in event management. You may learn how to create and execute a marketing plan for products/services; help manage budgets, distribution plans and carry out research.
     </p>
     <p>
      As an advanced apprentice, you may be employed in a more senior marketing/market research role or be working in the areas of advertising or public relations.
