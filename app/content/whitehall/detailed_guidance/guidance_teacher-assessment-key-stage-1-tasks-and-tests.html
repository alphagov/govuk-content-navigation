        This guidance is for the 2014 to 2015 test cycle only. The test administrator’s guide is currently being refreshed for the 2015 to 2016 test cycle and will include this information.

      <p>
       Teachers must administer the statutory national curriculum tasks and tests to pupils who are at the end of the key stage 1 programme of study. These assessments are designed to test pupils’ knowledge and understanding of the programmes of study and provide a snapshot of a pupil’s attainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key stage 1 ‘Assessments and reporting arrangements’ explain which pupils should take the tasks and tests and how results should be used to inform teacher assessment (
       <abbr title="teacher assessment">
        TA
       </abbr>
       ) judgements in English and mathematics.

       Which tasks and tests to use
      </h2>
      <p>
       Schools should select tasks and tests appropriate to the level at which each pupil is judged to be working.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schools must use the 2007 and / or 2009 key stage 1 national curriculum tests. You may choose to administer the 2007 tests to some pupils in the class and 2009 tests to others. However, you must ensure that the longer and shorter writing tasks and spelling test are from the same year.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can order tasks and test materials from the ‘Test orders’ section of the
       <a href="https://www.education.gov.uk/ncatools" rel="external">
        NCA tools website
       </a>
       until Friday 28 November.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the final year that you can use the 2007 and 2009 versions of the tests. These will be replaced by a new suite of materials when the new national curriculum is assessed for the first time in May 2016. Please bear this in mind when considering what materials you need.
      </p>
      <h2 id="when-to-administer-the-tasks-and-tests">
       When to administer the tasks and tests
      </h2>
      <p>
       You can administer the tasks and tests at any time. Pupils must not to be tested more than once during the year in each subject or attainment target.
      </p>
      <h2 id="how-to-administer-and-mark-the-tasks-and-tests">
       How to administer and mark the tasks and tests
      </h2>
      <p>
       You must administer the tasks and tests according to the instructions in the teacher’s handbooks (for the tasks) and teacher’s guides (for the tests). You can order the 2007 and 2009 tasks and tests from the ‘Test orders’ section of the
       <a href="https://www.education.gov.uk/ncatools" rel="external">
        NCA tools website
       </a>
       . The deadline for placing test orders is Friday 28 November.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tasks and tests must be administered under appropriate conditions so that all schools adhere to agreed national standards. As you can administer the tasks and tests to small groups of pupils throughout the school year, you should make sure no other pupils can see the tests or overhear discussions about them. This is to ensure task and test outcomes are valid for all pupils.
      </p>
      <p>
       The teacher’s handbooks and guides include mark schemes, level threshold information and age standardised scores so that you can mark the tests and attribute appropriate levels.

       Schools are not obliged to report task or test results to parents. However, you should provide them if requested.
