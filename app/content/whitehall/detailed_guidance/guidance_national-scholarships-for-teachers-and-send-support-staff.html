       The National Scholarship Fund provides an opportunity for teachers and special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) support staff to:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        increase their specialist knowledge in the priority area of SEND
       </li>
       <li>
        renew their passion for teaching
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The goal is that this will also lead to the sharing of learning, knowledge and expertise across the school system, and to increasing public perception of teachers as scholars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scholarship awards funding for continuing professional development courses or activities that are judged by the application process to be intellectually rigorous and challenging.
      </p>
      <p>
       This year the Department for Education is interested in applications from groups of teachers or SEND support staff who want to work together. The activity should deepen SEND knowledge and ability to provide effective support to pupils with SEND.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, teachers or support staff across a group of schools could apply to complete a course on assessing and supporting pupils with an autism spectrum disorder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eligible institutions include:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        maintained schools (including special schools)
       </li>
       <li>
        non-maintained special schools
       </li>
       <li>
        city technology colleges
       </li>
       <li>
        academies
       </li>
       <li>
        free schools
       </li>
       <li>
        pupil referral units
       </li>
       <li>
        sixth form colleges
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You can’t apply for funding if you’ve already started a course through this scholarship fund and want to secure funding for additional parts or years.

       The goal of the fund is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        create expectations in the teaching profession about the importance of scholarship
       </li>
       <li>
        enhance the idea that teachers, alongside university academics, are guardians of the intellectual life of the nation
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The majority of scholarships will be awarded to teachers who apply to study up to Master’s level.
