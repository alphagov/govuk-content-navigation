     <p>
      The SEND reforms were introduced in September 2014 and introduce a new approach that seeks to join up help across education, health and care from birth to age 25.  Help will be offered at the earliest possible point, with children and young people with SEND and their parents or carers fully involved in decisions about their support and what they want to achieve. This will help lead to better outcomes and more efficient ways of working.
     </p>
     <p>
      Resources are available to support local authorities, institutions, young people and parents understand what the reforms mean for them, including
