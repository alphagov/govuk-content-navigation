      While many people book their own travel arrangements online, plenty of people in the UK prefer arranging holidays through bonded travel agents, travel agencies and tour operators. These services make up the travel services industry.

      This apprenticeship is perfect for those with a keen interest in travel but it’s not a paid holiday. Working in this sector requires hard work, excellent customer service skills, and a firm grasp on product knowledge.

      The travel services apprenticeship has three pathways.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the leisure &amp; business route focuses on customer-facing roles like travel agent or business travel consultant
      </li>
      <li>
       the tour operator (head office) pathway, could see you working for an organisation like Thomas Cook and helping customers make travel plans by checking availability and costs, making bookings and processing payments.
      </li>
      <li>
       the specialist tour operator (field staff) pathway, could see you provide support to customers on their holiday as a resort representative or tour guide
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      After an apprenticeship, there are opportunities to progress to managerial roles within your organisation. If you work for a larger organisation, you might even get the chance to work further afield as resort staff or cabin crew.
