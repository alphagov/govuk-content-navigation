      To become an
      <abbr title="specialist leader of education">
       SLE
      </abbr>
      , you need to have been in a leadership role other than headteacher for at least 2 years. Your headteacher will be asked to confirm that you’re in an appropriate role. Higher level teaching assistants are not eligible to apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can be from any type or phase of school.
     </p>
     <p>
      You don’t need to be in an outstanding school or a school that is part of a
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teaching-schools-a-guide-for-potential-applicants">
       teaching school alliance
      </a>

     </p>
     <p>
      You must have at least 1 specialism from our areas of expertise, which are based on the areas of focus in the Ofsted Common Inspection Framework (September 2016):

     </p>
     <p>
      This may be done through one-to-one or group support and could involve a variety of activities, such as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       data analysis

      <li>

       joint action planning
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If selected, you’ll be expected to provide evidence that your work has had a positive impact on outcomes for children and young people by developing leadership capacity in other schools.

     <p>
      The role lasts for 4 years, at which time there’ll be a review. The types of placements will vary. For example, one might be a 2-day diagnostic exercise, while another might require a 3 month, full time support role. Time may be taken as a block of consecutive days or spread over a longer period.
     </p>
     <p>
      There’s no minimum or maximum time commitment. You and your school will need to think carefully about capacity and negotiate your availability together.
