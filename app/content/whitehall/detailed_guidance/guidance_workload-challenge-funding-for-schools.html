     <p>
      The National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) is offering grant funding of up to £30,000 for groups of schools to carry out collaborative research projects into efficient and effective approaches which reduce workload related to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       marking
      </li>
      <li>
       planning and resources
      </li>
      <li>
       data management
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      This funding will help you take the principles and recommendations from
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reducing-teachers-workload/reducing-teachers-workload">
       three independent reports into workload
      </a>
      to investigate your current practices and develop long term solutions to better manage teacher workload.
     </p>
     <p>
      We’re also hoping that schools will develop tools and processes that could work as a form of recognition or accreditation for schools which are actively working to keep workload at proportionate and manageable levels.
