       Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
       Advanced learner loans are available for individuals aged 19 or above to undertake approved qualifications at Levels 3 to Level 6, at an approved provider in England. Advanced learner loans give individuals access to financial support for tuition costs similar to that available in higher education and are administered by Student Finance England.
      </p>
      <p>
       The availability of loans at Level 3 for 19 to 23 year olds does not replace an individual’s legal entitlement for full funding for a first full Level 3 qualification.
      </p>
      <p>
       Advanced learner loans are paid directly to the college or training organisation on behalf of an individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not means tested or subject to credit checks and any individual who meets the criteria will be able to apply for a loan regardless of their current employment status.
      </p>
      <p>
       To become an approved provider, colleges and training organisations must be approved on the
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sfa-register-of-training-organisations">
        Register of Training Organisations
       </a>
       and in receipt of an advanced learner loans facility agreement with the Skills Funding Agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Advanced learner loans facility agreements are only issued following formal selection processes. The Skills Funding Agency uses its weekly
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/skills-funding-agency-update">
        Update newsletter
       </a>
       to advertise new opportunities for providers to express an interest in having a loan facility, as and when such opportunities arise.

       The availability of loans at Level 3 for 19 to 23 year olds does not replace an individual’s legal entitlement for full funding for a first full Level 3 qualification.
