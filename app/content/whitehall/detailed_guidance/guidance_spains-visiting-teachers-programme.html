      Overview
     </h2>
     <p>
      Spain’s Visiting Teachers programme enables teachers from Spain to teach in other countries for a period of one year or longer. It has been running successfully since 1986 between Spain and the United States and Canada.
     </p>
     <p>
      We know that recruiting modern foreign language teachers can be challenging, so the programme has been extended to England. It provides opportunities for schools in England to recruit high-quality modern foreign language teachers from Spain for one year initially. Internationally trained teachers can make a valuable contribution to education.
