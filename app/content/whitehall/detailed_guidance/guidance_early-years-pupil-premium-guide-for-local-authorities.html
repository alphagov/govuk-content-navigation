     </p>
     <h3 id="identifying-eligible-children">
      Identifying eligible children
     </h3>
     <p>
      Early years providers are ultimately responsible for identifying eligible children. However, you should encourage providers to speak to parents to find out who is eligible for
      <abbr title="early years pupil premium">
       EYPP
      </abbr>
      funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      In particular, providers should speak to the parents of children who took up the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/free-early-education">
       early education entitlement for 2-year-olds
      </a>
      , as most of these children will attract
      <abbr title="early years pupil premium">
       EYPP
      </abbr>
      when they turn 3.
     </p>
     <h2 id="eligibility-checks">
      Eligibility checks
     </h2>
     <p>
      You must check the eligibility of any child a parent or provider alerts you to. In most cases you will have to check twice:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>
        You should first check a child’s eligibility when a provider or parent tells you that a child may be eligible. If you wish to check a child’s eligibility before they begin to take up their free education entitlement, we suggest that you don’t do this more than a term in advance in case the family’s circumstances change.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        You should check the child’s eligibility again in the academic year when the child is taking up their 4-year-old entitlement. This check will help you find out if the child’s circumstances have changed and they have stopped being eligible as a result. We recommend carrying out this second check at the beginning of the academic year in September, but you can use a different date if you wish.
       </p>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      In cases where a child becomes eligible when they are already 4 years old, you will not have to run a second check.
     </p>
     <p>
      When you check a child’s eligibility, you should inform the child’s parents or legal carers of the outcome of the check. You should also inform the early years provider where the child receives their early years education. You shouldn’t inform anyone else.
     </p>
     <p>
      Please be aware that once a child previously eligible for
      <abbr title="early years pupil premium">
       EYPP
      </abbr>
      starts school they will not become automatically eligible for the school-age pupil premium.

     <h3 id="national-rate">
      National rate

     <p>
      You must fund all eligible early years providers in your area at the national rate of 53p per hour per eligible pupil. You can find more information about this national rate in the
      <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3352/regulation/16/made" rel="external">

      This means that in the financial year 2015 to 2016, providers will receive £302.10 for each eligible child who takes up the full

      You should allocate the funding to early years providers based on:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       how many eligible pupils they have
      </li>
      <li>
       how many hours of state-funded early years education these children take up
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      You can’t place conditions on the funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      This means that
      <abbr title="early years pupil premium">
       EYPP
      </abbr>
      funding should follow the eligible child rather than the provider. If a child moves to a different provider part way through the year, they should not lose any of their funding because you will have calculated the amount of
      <abbr title="early years pupil premium">
       EYPP
      </abbr>
      each provider gets based on the hours of take-up.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can treat the
      <abbr title="early years pupil premium">
       EYPP
      </abbr>
      like other supplementary payments to the hourly rate set in your local early years single funding formula. For example, in cases where you fund the provider on a termly rather than an hourly basis (eg schools with early years provision),  you can pay providers for one-third of the full early years entitlement (ie 190 hours’ worth of
      <abbr title="early years pupil premium">
       EYPP
      </abbr>
      ) per eligible child per term.
     </p>
     <p>
      In cases where a child who lives in your area receives early education at a provider based in a different local authority, the provider’s local authority is responsible for:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       funding the
       <abbr title="early years pupil premium">
        EYPP
