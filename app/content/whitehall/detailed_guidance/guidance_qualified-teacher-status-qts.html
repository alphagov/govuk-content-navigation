      You must have qualified teacher status (
      <abbr title="qualified teacher status">
       QTS
      </abbr>
      ) to take up a teaching post in England in a:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       maintained primary school
      </li>
      <li>
       maintained secondary school

      <li>
       maintained special school
      </li>
      <li>
       non-maintained special school
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Maintained schools form part of the state-funded schools system in England (including primary, secondary and special schools for pupils with special educational needs). In maintained schools funding and oversight is generally through the local authority. They make up the majority of schools in England and are mostly either community schools or voluntary controlled schools (where the local authority employs the school’s staff and is responsible for admissions) or foundation and voluntary aided schools, where the school’s governing body employs the staff and has responsibility for admissions.

      The National College for Teaching and Leadership (
      <abbr title="National College for Teaching and Leadership">
       NCTL

      <abbr title="qualified teacher status">
       QTS
      </abbr>
      . We also award
      <abbr title="qualified teacher status">

      From the 19 December 2016 teachers who are recognised in the
      <abbr title="European Economic Area">
       EEA
      </abbr>
      but who are only qualified to teach pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) can apply for partial qualified teacher status in England. A teacher with partial qualified teacher status can be appointed to a qualified teacher post in a special school or to teach pupils in a specialist unit in mainstream schools. Partial qualified teacher status also exempts a teacher from the requirement to serve a statutory induction period in England. This change is due to an amendment to Council Directive 2005/36/EC. EU Member States must recognise qualifications when they entitle a professional to work in specific areas of a regulated profession.
