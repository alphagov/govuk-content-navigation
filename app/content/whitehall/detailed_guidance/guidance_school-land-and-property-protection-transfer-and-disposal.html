     <p>
      This guide contains information about the protection of playing fields owned by local authorities for schools and academies, and several disposal of assets issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      It also includes information about transfer of land and property when schools change category and compulsory purchase orders.

      Disposal of school land
     </h2>
     <p>
      Local authorities wanting to dispose of school land previously needed consent under Schedule 35A to the Education Act 1996. On 1 February 2012, Schedule 35A was repealed by Schedule 14 to the Education Act 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schedule 14 also substituted a new Schedule 1 to the Academies Act 2010 which extends the requirement to ask for Secretary of State consent to dispose of community school land to include all land in which a freehold or leasehold interest is held by the local authority and which has been used for any school (including any academy) in the last 8 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local authorities wanting to dispose of playing field land still need consent under Section 77 of the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998, but consent is now also required for disposal of any land used by a school or academy under Schedule 1 to the Academies Act 2010. Academies also need consent to any leases or disposals under their Funding Agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Please

       contact Education Funding Agency
      </a>
      with any applications and enquiries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools and academies on land leased from the local authority also need consent to change the use of playing field land – for example to build a new teaching block on it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Detail of the information that should be provided in respect of playing field land disposals is set out the Department for Education’s non-statutory

      Disposal of school playing fields
     </h3>
     <p>
      Details of the procedures and legislation governing the disposal of school playing field land held by local authorities, governing bodies, foundation bodies and trustees are set out in the Department for Education’s non-statutory
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protection-of-school-playing-fields-and-public-land-advice">
       advice about the protection of school playing fields and public land
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      This advice describes the main circumstances when relevant bodies need to seek the consent of the Secretary of State for Education to dispose, or change the use, of land used by schools, including playing field land. It also describes how the Secretary of State will assess applications for consent to dispose, or change the use, of such land. The relevant legislation is Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 (as amended).
     </p>
     <p>
      Potential applicants should remember that the Secretary of State wishes to ensure that playing fields continue to be protected. The Department for Education will usually only agree to the sale of school playing fields if the sports and curriculum needs of schools and their neighbouring schools can continue to be met. Sale proceeds must be used to improve sports or education facilities and any new sports facilities must be sustainable for at least 10 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary of State expects applicants to have first investigated and exhausted all other possible sources of funding before considering the sale of school playing fields.

      Academy trusts wishing to dispose of playing field land for which they hold the freehold are required under the terms of their funding agreement, and under the new Schedule 1 of the Academies Act 2010, to seek the consent of the Secretary of State before making any disposal. They should do this through application to Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">

      ).
     </p>

      The governing body, foundation body or trustees of a foundation, trust or voluntary school are also able to dispose of land and buildings they hold on trust for use by their school.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, certain procedures need to be followed if the property was provided, acquired or enhanced at public expense.
     </p>
     <p>
      The relevant legislation is Schedule 22 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 (SSFA) (as amended by both Schedule 4 to the Education and Inspections Act 2006, and Schedule 1 to the Academies Act 2010 as amended by Schedule 14 to the Education Act 2011).
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing body, foundation body or trustees are required by Schedule 22 SSFA to give notice to the Secretary of State of their intention to dispose of their freehold interest in educational land. The Secretary of State may then decide to exercise powers under Schedule 1 to the Academies Act 2010 to direct the transfer of any part of the land to an academy or free school. Schedule 1 allows the Secretary of State to consider whether land can be used for a free school or an academy.

      Section 554 orders
     </h2>
     <p>
      In certain circumstances, Section 554 of the 1996 Act enables the Secretary of State to make fresh provision for the endowments of trusts held or used for the provision of religious education in such a way that they remain for the benefit of the maintained education services.
     </p>
     <p>
      So far as educational charitable trusts associated with voluntary, foundation or former grant-maintained schools are concerned, a failure is usually brought about by the closure of the school to which they relate. When such schools close, the trusts governing the property fail. Section 554 orders create new trusts for the property. These trusts will usually authorise the diocese to sell the property and use the proceeds of sale to benefit other church schools in the diocese.
     </p>
