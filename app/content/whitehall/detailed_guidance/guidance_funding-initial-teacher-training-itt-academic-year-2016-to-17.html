      Graduates with a 2:1 and above, who are passionate about their subject and have the potential to be inspirational teachers can apply for a scholarship with the appropriate professional body.  As well as the financial award, scholars will receive a package of additional benefits provided by the professional bodies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Trainees with a 2:2 may be awarded a scholarship in exceptional circumstances, if they have significant relevant experience.
     </p>
     <p>
      Trainees awarded a scholarship cannot receive a bursary. Trainees who aren’t awarded a scholarship are eligible for a standard bursary.

      The rates detailed in the table above include £6,000 grant-uplift to support the increased salary for mathematics and physics. To receive this higher rate, schools need to offer a salary of at least £21,000 nationally, £22,000 in London fringe, £24,000 in outer London or £25,000 in inner London. If a school doesn’t wish to offer a salary of at least these levels, they’ll receive the same grant rates as for chemistry, computing, and languages.  Further information will be available shortly in the School Direct (salaried) funding manual.
