      Notice of an inspection
     </h2>
     <p>
      An inspection will normally last for 2 weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The lead inspector will usually inform the local authority’s director of children’s services (DCS) 5 working days before the start of the on-site inspection.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the DCS (or their equivalent) is unavailable, the lead inspector will ask to speak to the most senior officer available with responsibility for school improvement.
     </p>
     <h2 id="during-the-inspections-first-week">
      During the inspection’s first week
     </h2>
     <p>
      The lead inspector will discuss the inspection process with the local authority. They will ask for meetings to be arranged with key personnel during the on-site visit in the inspection’s second week. The lead inspector will also ask for information to be available to the inspection team at the start of the on-site inspection, for example a summary of the authority’s self-evaluation (if available) and contextual background.
     </p>
     <p>
      A focused inspection of a number of individual schools will inform the inspection of your local authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      A separate telephone survey of schools and academies within the local authority area that are not under inspection will also be used to gather evidence.
     </p>
     <h2 id="during-the-inspections-second-week-on-site-visit">
      During the inspection’s second week: on-site visit
     </h2>
     <p>
      The lead inspector will meet briefly with the chief executive and/or DCS at the beginning of the inspection to confirm arrangements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors must spend as much time as possible gathering evidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      Meetings must be held with elected members, senior and operational staff, school-based staff and governors and other stakeholders.
     </p>
     <p>
      The lead inspector should meet the DCS or their equivalent throughout the inspection to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       provide an update on emerging issues and enable further evidence to be provided
      </li>
      <li>
       allow the DCS, their equivalent or nominee to raise concerns, including those related to the conduct of the inspection or of individual inspectors
      </li>
      <li>
       alert the DCS to any serious concerns
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="feedback">
      Feedback
     </h3>
     <p>
      At the end of the inspection, there must be a brief feedback meeting that includes, where possible, the DCS or their equivalent, the lead elected member and chief executive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors will share and clarify the main inspection findings and outline how the local authority can improve further.
     </p>
     <h2 id="after-the-inspection-visit">
      After the inspection visit
     </h2>
     <p>
      The inspection report will be sent to the DCS or their equivalent shortly after the end of the inspection, with 5 working days for comments on its factual accuracy.
     </p>
     <p>
      The local authority will then receive an electronic version of the final report, usually within 28 working days of the end of the inspection.
     </p>
     <p>
      This should be sent to stakeholders within 5 working days.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <a href="http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">
       report will be published online

     <h2 id="complaints-about-inspections">
      Complaints about inspections
     </h2>
     <p>
      Any complaints about an inspection should be raised immediately with the lead inspector.
     </p>
     <p>
      For issues that can’t be resolved during the inspection, you can
