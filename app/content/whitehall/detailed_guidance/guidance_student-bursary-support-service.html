     <h3 id="apply-for-care-to-learn-support">
      Apply for Care to Learn support
     </h3>
     <p>
      The service portal is used to support young parents’ / students’ applications for summer retainers and new applications for Care to Learn.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the majority of cases, student eligibility – not whole application eligibility - is established as the application is input. When the service is unable to establish student eligibility the
      <abbr title="Student Bursary Support Service">
       SBSS
      </abbr>
      will notify the student if additional information is required or if the student is ineligible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Childcare providers and education institutions will be contacted by the
      <abbr title="Student Bursary Support Service">
       SBSS
      </abbr>
      and asked to provide information via the portal about childcare costs, study programme hours, travel costs etc to complete each student’s application. To ensure initial payments are not delayed, childcare providers and education institutions should provide this information via the portal as soon as possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of this process, education institutions are required to confirm that the existence of the child(ren) to be cared for has been verified. To do this, the student is required to provide either a copy of the child’s birth certificate or a letter confirming receipt of child benefit for that child.
     </p>
     <p>
      The service can only fully process an application when the student details, child details, education institution details and childcare provider details are fully completed by each party. No payments can be made until the application is fully complete and verified.
     </p>
     <p>
      Students, childcare providers and education institutions can update applications on the portal for changes to, for example, personal details, study programme, travel arrangements, childcare hours or costs and childcare provider.
     </p>
     <p>
      Care to Learn applications started and saved but not submitted will expire after 90 days.  Students requiring Care to Learn support will have to re-apply if the application expires. Notifications will be sent to students whose applications are about to expire.
     </p>
     <p>
      The service notifies students, childcare providers and education institutions when letters confirming eligibility, payment plans and any other correspondence are available on the portal.
     </p>
     <h3 id="update-organisation-details">
      Update organisation details
     </h3>
     <p>
      Education institutions and childcare providers with young parents claiming Care to Learn can maintain their banking details (administrator users only).  The portal can be used to upload bank proofs when the system is unable to automatically validate bank account details.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each organisation will be assigned a user account with administration level access.  This user can set-up other user accounts for the organisation if required.
     </p>
     <p>
      A dashboard is available to users which highlights actions that require attention or are overdue. Organisations receive email notifications when actions are required or correspondence is available on the portal, ie new Care to Learn applications, attendance monitoring returns to be completed, etc.
     </p>
     <h3 id="record-student-and-child-attendance">
      Record student and child attendance
     </h3>
     <p>
      Monthly attendance monitoring returns for Care to Learn must be completed via the
      <abbr title="Student Bursary Support Service">
       SBSS
      </abbr>
      portal by education institutions (to confirm student attendance) and childcare providers (to confirm child attendance).
     </p>
     <p>
      Notifications are emailed to education institutions and childcare providers when attendance monitoring requires their attention.  Reminders are emailed when returns are late.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payments to education institutions and childcare providers cannot be released until both attendance monitoring forms have been completed.

     <h2 id="submit-a-claim-for-16-to-19-bursary-fund-for-vulnerable-students">
      Submit a claim for 16 to 19 Bursary Fund for vulnerable students
     </h2>
     <p>
      Education institutions must submit claims via the portal on behalf of their 16 to 19 Bursary Fund vulnerable students.
     </p>
     <p>
      Claims are validated as the details are entered.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are no restrictions on the number of claims that an education institution may submit.  A claim may contain multiple students. Claims may be partially recorded and saved for submission at a later date.  Only validated and submitted claims will be processed by the service.
     </p>
     <h3 id="secure-access-to-data">
      Secure access to data
     </h3>
     <p>
      The portal requires a username and password to gain access, this ensures that the data is held securely and only accessed by an authorised user.  Users may access the portal using Facebook and Google account credentials. Guidance is available on the portal on how to set up secure passwords.
     </p>
     <p>
      The service has been accredited to meet strict government security standards.
