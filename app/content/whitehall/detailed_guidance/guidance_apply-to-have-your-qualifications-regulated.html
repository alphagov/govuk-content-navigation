      Ofqual regulates certain qualifications,
      <a href="#end-point-assessments-for-apprenticeships">
       end-point assessments
      </a>
      and the organisations which offer them. 
We don’t regulate training courses. The difference between a training course and a qualification is that a qualification:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       tests someone’s knowledge, skills or understanding of the subject
      </li>
      <li>
       is only awarded to someone who has demonstrated a specified level of attainment
      </li>
      <li>
       awards a certificate to anyone who completes it successfully
      </li>
     </ul>

      What does it mean to be regulated by Ofqual?
     </h3>
     <p>
      Qualifications, apart from GCSEs, AS or A levels, do not have to be regulated by Ofqual. However, if you want your qualification to be studied in publicly funded schools and colleges, you will need to be regulated by us.
     </p>
     <p>
      Being regulated means being recognised by Ofqual to offer certain
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/types-of-regulated-qualifications">
       types of qualifications
      </a>
      . If you want us to regulate your qualifications, you have to apply to become a recognised awarding organisation - an Ofqual-approved provider - of those qualifications. We have a thorough process we use to decide whether you should become a recognised awarding organisation. This is to make sure that the standards of qualifications are maintained.
     </p>
     <p>
      We won’t regulate any qualifications that we don’t recognise you for and these won’t appear on our
      <a href="http://register.ofqual.gov.uk/" rel="external">
       register of regulated qualifications
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      A regulated qualification is always a regulated qualification. This includes when it’s taken by students in a different country or when it’s privately funded.

      End-point assessments for apprenticeships

     <p>
      An end-point assessment is a test of knowledge gained during an apprenticeship. It:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       is designed to test knowledge of all areas of learning covered in the apprenticeship
      </li>
      <li>
       is taken at the end of an apprenticeship
      </li>
      <li>
       assesses whether an apprentice has developed the knowledge, skills and behaviours identified by employers for a particular occupation
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We will regulate end-point assessments as qualifications. For more information on end-point assessments, read ‘
