      Charging and remissions policies

     <p>
      You must publish your school’s charging and ‘remissions’ policies (this means when you cancel fees). The policies must include details of:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the activities or cases where your school will charge pupils’ parents
      </li>
      <li>
       the circumstances where your school will make an exception on a payment you would normally expect to receive under your charging policy
      </li>
     </ul>
