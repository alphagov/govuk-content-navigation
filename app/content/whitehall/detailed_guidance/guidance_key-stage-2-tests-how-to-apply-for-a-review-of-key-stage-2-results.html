         This guidance reflects changes to the reviews process due to the removal of levels and introduction of scaled scores.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have updated the review application system for 2016 following school feedback. A user guide will also be available on
         <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">
          NCA tools
         </a>
         from 5 July to help guide schools through the online application process.

        <h2 id="when-to-request-a-review">
         When to request a review
        </h2>
        <p>
         A school can request a review if they believe that there is a discrepancy between how question(s) have been marked and the published mark scheme. A successful review would correct the discrepancy and result in a change leading to:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          the pupil achieving the expected standard
         </li>
         <li>
          the pupil not meeting the expected standard
         </li>
         <li>
          or a change of 3 or more marks to the raw score
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         A scaled score calculator will be available on
         <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">
          NCA tools
         </a>
         from 5 July for schools to use when deciding whether to apply for a review. This will enable schools to calculate what effect a change to the total raw score has on the scaled score awarded. 2016 key stage 2 test materials and mark schemes are available at National curriculum assessments: past papers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Schools can also apply for a review if they believe there has been a clerical error in the marking process.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will only accept review applications made by schools and authorised by the headteacher or a delegated senior member of staff. We will not accept applications from pupils or parents.

         Marking review query

        <p>
         Schools can apply for a marking review for as many pupils as they wish, as long as they meet the criteria stated above.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should be aware that a pupil’s total raw score and/or scaled score may go up or down as a result of a marking review.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will carry out marking reviews for those pupils who have had a marking review application raised for them by the deadline, via
         <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">

        <p>
         You can apply for a clerical review if:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          a test marked on paper has an error, such as incorrect addition of the marks
         </li>
         <li>
          a test script has been matched to the wrong pupil
         </li>
         <li>
          there is an error on the school attendance register, eg an attendance code needs to be corrected
         </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="charges">
         Charges
        </h4>
        <p>
         We will only charge for a review if:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          a marking review does not result in a change to the achievement of the expected standard, or a total raw score changes by fewer than 3 marks
         </li>
         <li>
          a clerical review does not correct a test script matched to the wrong pupil, and produces no change to raw score or scaled score, or the assigned code as to why the pupil has not sat the test
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         If any charges are applicable, we will invoice your school once the review process has been completed.

        <p>
         When applying for a review of a certain subject, we will ask you whether you have a marking query, or you can select from a list of possible clerical queries. For a clerical review, once you have selected the appropriate query you then need to provide information about the potential error as prompted.
        </p>
        <p>
         For a marking review you have the option to select whether you have a marking query with a particular question(s), or all questions on an individual test paper, or all test papers for a certain subject. You can then provide details about your query at question or paper level. However, for marking reviews, we will review all papers sat by the pupil for that test.
        </p>
        <h3 id="tests-marked-on-paper">
         Tests marked on paper
        </h3>
        <p>
         We mark the following tests on paper:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          all braille, enlarged print and modified large print versions of the tests
         </li>
         <li>
          test scripts that could not be scanned for onscreen marking, eg due to the condition of the test scripts
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         If applying for a review, you must indicate whether you are applying for a marking review or clerical review. When you apply for a review via
         <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">
          NCA tools
         </a>
         it will be clear which test papers, if any, were marked on paper. You need to return them in order for us to complete the review.
        </p>
        <p>
         Instructions on where to send test scripts are on
         <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">
          NCA tools
         </a>
         . A marking review for tests marked on paper also includes a clerical review of the addition of marks on all test scripts submitted. You need to send us the original test script(s) as we will not accept photocopies.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will only consider review applications if a pupil’s test script hasn’t been amended or annotated in any way following marking (eg by circling the evidence for review or adding sticky notes to the test script). This is so that the review panel can reach an impartial judgement. You have the opportunity to provide comments on the review application at both question and paper level.
        </p>
        <p>
         We reserve the right to reject review applications without giving any further reason if a school has made amendments of any kind to a test script.
        </p>
        <h3 id="returning-test-scripts">
         Returning test scripts
        </h3>
        <p>
         Only review applications that include tests marked on paper, which were returned to your school, need to be sent back for review. If any test scripts were marked on paper these will be highlighted for you during the online review application.
        </p>
        <h2 id="the-reviews-process">
         The reviews process
        </h2>
        <p>
         During a marking review, we check all components of the test to make sure that the original application of the mark scheme was accurate and no clerical errors were made. For example, for mathematics, we check Paper 1: arithmetic, Paper 2: reasoning and Paper 3: reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>
         A panel of experienced markers who have achieved the highest quality marking standards throughout the marking period carry out reviews. They complete training for review marking and must successfully re-standardise before reviewing any pupils’ test scripts. Re-standardisation is a test of the review marker’s ability to correctly mark pupil responses in accordance with the mark scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
         Review markers are supervised and their work is sampled to ensure that the mark scheme for the subject they are reviewing is applied correctly. If they do not apply a mark scheme as required, or do not adhere to the review procedures, they will be stopped from marking and any review marking they have carried out will be reviewed again by another review marker.
        </p>
        <p>
         Marks may be awarded or deducted following the review of a pupil’s test papers. As a result, a review can lead to an increase or decrease of the total raw score which may affect the scaled score and the achievement of the expected standard.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will amend pupil result(s) on
         <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">
          NCA tools
         </a>

         An outcome of your review application, a notification of changes sheet and a marking review report form will be available for each application. These all contain important information about your review. The marking review report form is completed by the review marker who checked your school’s test scripts. This will contain information about the marking for all pupils submitted for a marking review.
        </p>
        <p>
         You will be able to access the reviewed test scripts using the script return section on NCA tools, to show the original marks with the review marks alongside, circled in blue.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you sent test scripts marked on paper for review, we will return them to your school by Friday 2 September. Review marks will be alongside the original marks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a mark is changed through the review process, the scaled score derived from the reviewed mark will not be taken into account in the provisional school level performance measures until after the school checking exercise takes place in September 2016.
