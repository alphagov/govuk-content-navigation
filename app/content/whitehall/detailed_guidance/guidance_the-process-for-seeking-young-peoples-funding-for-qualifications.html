      <li>
       the delivery of qualifications to young people in England

     <p>
      This guide describes the process involved to seek public funding in England for the delivery of a qualification to students up to the age of 19 years old. This includes Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA

      This guide also applies to amendments to qualifications that are currently eligible for public funding in England for young people.

      This guide does not provide any information about qualifications that are only eligible for:
     </p>

      <li>

      Regulated awarding organisations use Ofqual’s Portal system to submit or amend qualification data to Ofqual.  When Ofqual regulate a qualification they give it a qualification number. On the last Tuesday of each month, the Department for Education (

       DfE

      ) gets a copy of Ofqual’s Portal data.  As a cut of the portal data is taken once a month, the date at which a qualification is submitted or amended in the portal will impact on the time taken for a qualification to complete the first step of the process.

      Section 96 approval is not an indication of whether or not a qualification will be included in the Key Stage 4 performance tables.  While schools are free to offer any qualification approved under section 96 for the relevant age group, Key Stage 4 performance tables will be restricted to qualifications that for the majority of young people:

     <ul>
      <li>
       are rigorous

      The date information recorded in the portal reflects a qualification’s current status.  It is also used to determine the section 96 approval dates and the
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      funding validity for a qualification.
     </p>

      When a qualification reaches its operational end date, it is still approved by the Secretary of State, but it is removed from the

       section 96 approved list

       section 96 archive list
      </a>
      until a future operational end date or review date is in place.
     </p>
     <p>
      Awarding organisations are responsible for maintaining date information for a qualification.  Any changes to the status of a qualification should be promptly resubmitted to Ofqual through the portal.  This will ensure that timely amendments are made to the Section 96 approval and
