      If you are a new school or a school teaching eligible pupils for the first time in the academic year 2016 to 2017, we will base your funding on data from the autumn 2016 school census.

       PE

     </p>
     <p>
      This means that you should use the premium to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       develop or add to the
       <abbr title="physical education">

       make improvements now that will benefit pupils joining the school in future years
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      For example, you can use your funding to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       hire qualified sports coaches to work with teachers
      </li>
