      Introduction
     </h2>
     <p>
      School governors and academy trust members and trustees have an important role in ensuring high standards of achievement for all children and young people in their school.
     </p>
     <p>
      You do this by:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        setting the school’s vision, ethos and strategic direction
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        holding the headteacher to account for the educational performance of the school and its pupils
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        overseeing the financial performance of the school, making sure its money is well spent
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We know that good financial performance delivers better outcomes. School governors have a duty to oversee the financial performance of the school by asking the leadership team question such as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        how confident are you that school curriculum planning achieves the maximum benefit from funding for the pupils?
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        has the school reviewed the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/schools-financial-efficiency-metric-tool">
         efficiency metric tool
        </a>
        ?
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        how can the school be more efficient with its funding?
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>

      Video - the important role of governors
     </h2>
     <p>
      Gillian Allcroft, Deputy Chief Executive of the National Governors’ Association, explains the important role of governors in overseeing the financial performance of schools.

       video
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      In this video, Gillian refers to 8 elements of effective governance. You can read about the 8 elements, together with other advice and guidance on the
      <a href="http://www.nga.org.uk" rel="external">

      Benchmarking

     <p>
      Many of you will be aware that the Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      ) provides benchmarking tools for schools and academies. These tools allow schools and academies to compare their income and costs to similar institutions by selecting factors which are relevant to their school.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example a large urban secondary with a high special educational needs (
      <abbr title="special educational needs">
       SEN
      </abbr>
      ) cohort would have a different income and expenditure profile to a small rural primary. As funding rates differ by local authority (
      <abbr title="local authority">
       LA
      </abbr>
      ) it is often more informative to benchmark against other schools in the same
      <abbr title="local authority">
       LA
      </abbr>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the information is not available via a benchmarking site or the school type is fairly unique such as a university technical college (
      <abbr title="university technical college">
       UTC
      </abbr>
      ), we encourage schools to benchmark by sharing information with similar schools. We encourage multi-academy trusts (MATs) to benchmark similar schools within their
      <abbr title="multi-academy trust">
       MAT
      </abbr>
      and also their top-slice charges with other MATs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Benchmarking can help you understand where the school’s expenditure is high compared to similar schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      Do you get benchmarking data and analysis in your school or trust?  Do you get enough information to understand why some expenditure lines are relatively high and others are relatively low?
     </p>
     <p>
      You  can read more about financial benchmarking and view information on the
      <a href="https://www.education.gov.uk/sfb/" rel="external">
