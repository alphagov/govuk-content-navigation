      This guide sets out Residential Bursary Fund (
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      ) policy in the 2016 to 2017 academic year and the requirements for the administration of the funding.  It also describes how Education Funding Agency (EFA) will collect monitoring information (MI) for the scheme.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions must ensure
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      is spent in line with the scheme rules set out in this guide.
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      may only be used to support accommodation cost for residential students and to support travel between the student’s term time lodgings (if they live off site) and the institution. It must not be used for hardship, help with childcare costs or to help with transport costs for non-residential students, ie for home to institution travel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions are reminded that
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      is designed to support students who are attending the institution to participate in the designated specialism.  Institutions have discretion to decide which students receive
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      support and how much they receive, however, EFA expects that the majority of the students receiving
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      help will be studying in the designated specialist subject areas.

     <p>
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      provides financial help towards the costs of accommodation for students attending one of the designated institutions delivering specialist provision, where that specialist provision needs the student to be resident in order to participate because it is not available locally and/or because it needs students to be available at unsociable hours on a regular basis.
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      enables young people to gain a substantial qualification in a specialist subject that they would not be able to get at a non-specialist institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      provides a contribution towards residential costs for those students the institution assesses as facing the most significant financial barriers to participation. It is not to provide support to all students on residentially delivered provision, or to necessarily cover the full costs for each student.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is expected that most
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      funding will be used to cover accommodation costs.
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      should be used to help students with the costs of accommodation while they are in further education. The accommodation may be owned or managed by the institution or by a private landlord.
     </p>
     <p>
      However,
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      may be used to help with travel costs between the student’s term time lodgings and the institution where appropriate. The use of
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      for travel costs for non-residential students, ie for home to institution travel costs, is not permitted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where institutions use
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      for travel costs for residential students living off campus, the amount spent should not exceed 15% of their total
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      allocation. To make sure
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      maintains its primary focus on residential support, spend on travel is also capped at £25,000. In other words, where 15% of the institution’s allocation is greater than £25,000, £25,000 is the maximum they may spend on travel costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      If institutions face exceptional circumstances and feel that more needs to be spent on travel, they should submit a business case to:

     <p>
      As
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      is awarded to institutions because they are delivering specialist provision, EFA expects that the majority of
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      funding will be used to support students enrolled on this provision.  However, institutions have the discretion, in line with this guide, to decide which students get
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      support and how much support they should get. Institutions should manage the number and size of
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      awards they make to keep within their budget, targeting available funds towards those facing the most significant financial barriers to participation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions should assess each student’s actual need for help with residential costs, ie by assessing their household income, before deciding whether to award
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      support.
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      should not be awarded simply because a student is enrolled in residentially delivered provision. It is good practice for institutions to publish their
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      policy to help students understand the criteria against which they will be assessed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      payments for accommodation must be made directly to the student’s landlord.  The landlord may be the institution itself if they provide accommodation directly or a private landlord. No payments should be made directly to the student - any such payment would be subject to the Social Security Amendment (Students and Income related Benefits Regulations 2000). Receipt of other benefits and/or financial support does not exclude a student from receiving help with residential costs if they are experiencing financial difficulties in meeting the costs associated with participating in education.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions may wish to consider keeping a contingency fund to respond to needs which come up later in the academic year in response to changes in a student’s circumstances rather than allocating all funds at the start of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions may use
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      to support residential students travel costs from their term time lodgings to site (up to the maximum of 15% of their allocation, capped at £25,000; in other words, where 15% of the institution’s allocation is greater than £25,000, £25,000 is the maximum amount that may be spent). The use of
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      for travel costs does not replace the statutory duty on local authorities to set out, in an annually published transport statement, the arrangements they will make to facilitate the participation in education or training of young people of sixth-form age.
     </p>
     <p>
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      should not be used by an institution for any purpose designed to give them a competitive advantage over other institutions; nor should
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      be used for:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       enrolment or administration fees
      </li>
      <li>
       fees for access to college facilities

      <li>
       block subsidy of transport

     <p>
      In determining arrangements for payment of
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      , institutions are subject to equalities legislation, which means they must not discriminate against their students on the basis of their protected characteristics. They are also subject to the public sector equality duty in section 149(1) of the Equality Act 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      Students should be told that if they are unhappy about the way in which their request for
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">

      </abbr>
      support is handled, they should follow the institution’s normal complaints procedure.

      Audit requirements
     </h2>
     <p>
      Institutions should maintain accurate and up to date records to evidence which students get
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      funding; confirm student eligibility for funding and show appropriate use of funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      The administration and allocation of
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      is subject to the institution’s normal governance and audit regimes.
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      funding is also subject to assurance as part of the normal assurance arrangements for 16 to 19 education and training. Institutions should note that, following an audit, funding may be recovered where
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      payments are found not to have been made in accordance with this guide.
     </p>
     <p>
      EFA cannot guarantee to reimburse any overspends by institutions as this is dependent on funds becoming available for recycling. Institutions are therefore advised not to overspend in the expectation that there will be a reallocation of funds later in the year. EFA will not reimburse any overspend that is not within the scheme rules as set out in this guide and may take action to recover any
      <abbr title="Residential Bursary Fund">
       RBF
      </abbr>
      funds spent outside the scheme rules.
