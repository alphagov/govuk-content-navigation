      Introduction
     </h2>
     <p>
      The reform and simplification of local authority funding formulae has raised the profile of the work of schools forums.
     </p>
     <p>
      The aim of this guide is to give schools and academies a clear understanding of the role of their local schools forum and encourage them to engage with them.
     </p>

      The role of the schools forum
     </h2>
     <p>
      Representatives from schools and academies make up the schools forum. There is also some representation from non-school organisations, such as nursery and 16-19 education providers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The forum acts as a consultative body on some issues and a decision making body on others.
     </p>
     <p>
      The forum acts in a consultative role for:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       changes to the local funding formula (the local authority makes the final decision)
      </li>
      <li>
       proposed changes to the operation of the minimum funding guarantee
      </li>
      <li>
       changes to or new contracts affecting schools (eg school meals)
      </li>
      <li>
       arrangements for pupils with special educational needs, in pupil referral units and in early years provision
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The forum decides:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       how much funding may be retained by the local authority within the dedicated schools grant (eg for providing an admissions service or providing additional funding for growing schools)
      </li>
      <li>
       any proposed carry forward of deficits on central spend from one year to the next
      </li>
      <li>
       proposals to de-delegate funding from maintained primary and secondary schools (eg for staff supply cover, insurance, behaviour support)
      </li>
      <li>
       changes to the scheme of financial management
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="schools-representation">
      Schools’ representation
     </h2>
     <p>
      Schools and academies’ (including free schools) representatives on the forum should be roughly proportionate to the number of pupils in each sector and would generally include representatives from:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       maintained nursery schools
      </li>
      <li>
       maintained primary schools
      </li>
      <li>
       maintained secondary schools
      </li>
      <li>
       maintained special schools
      </li>
      <li>
       maintained pupil referral units
      </li>
      <li>
       mainstream academies (including free schools)
      </li>
      <li>
       special academies (including free schools)
      </li>
      <li>
       alternative provision academies (including free schools)
      </li>
      <li>
       post-16 education providers
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Middle schools do not form a category of schools in their own right and school forums treat them according to their deemed status.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where there is at least one school in a particular category, there must be at least one representative for that group on the forum.
     </p>
     <p>
      In maintained schools, governors and headteachers (or their representatives) should elect their representatives  by the appropriate phase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Academy trusts should elected academy members in their local authority area.
     </p>
     <h2 id="responsibilities-of-schools-and-their-representatives">
      Responsibilities of schools and their representatives
     </h2>
     <p>
      Schools can expect to have their views canvassed and to receive feedback from their representatives
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools forum members have a responsibility to represent the interests of their peer group rather than the interests of their own individual school.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools staff and governors should make sure that the representatives they choose are competent to act as their advocates.
     </p>
     <p>
      They should also ensure that they are aware of schools forum business and make their views known about decisions affecting schools’ finance.
     </p>
     <h2 id="responsibilities-of-local-authorities">
      Responsibilities of local authorities
     </h2>
     <p>
      Local authorities must publish all schools forum papers well in advance of each meeting.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any recommendations should be clear and local authority responsible officers should attend meetings to provide further information and advice. Local authority officers should not dominate the meeting.
     </p>
     <p>
      All schools forum meetings must be open to the public. Observers do not have an automatic right to speak at meetings, but the chair may allow contributions where appropriate.
