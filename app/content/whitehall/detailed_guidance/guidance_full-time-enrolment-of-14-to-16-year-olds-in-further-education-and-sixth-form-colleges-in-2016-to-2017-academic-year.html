      Since September 2013, general further education colleges and sixth-form colleges (colleges) have been able to enrol, and receive direct funding from the Education Funding Agency (EFA) for 14- to 16-year-olds who wish to study high-quality vocational qualifications alongside general qualifications including English and mathematics within the Key Stage 4 curriculum.

     <p>
      Proposals for enrolling young people aged 14 or 15 on 31 August in the year they start their programme of study for direct funding by the EFA should be signed off by the principal and the chair of governors and made available for inspection if required by Ofsted or the EFA.
     </p>
     <p>
      Colleges should have informed the EFA of their intent to directly enrol full-time 14- to 16-year-olds in the 2016 to 2017 academic year by the 30 June 2016. The EFA will consider late notifications after this date on a case-by-case basis, and funding for the 14 to 16 cohort cannot be guaranteed where the 30 June deadline has been missed. Colleges are expected to have discussed their intention to directly enrol 14- to 16-year-olds with relevant local authorities, before enrolment starts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Colleges are required, (as part of their overall assessment of steps to be taken) to provide a suitable learning environment, and to complete the readiness to open checklist (Annex A).

      While the education may take place all around the college, there should be a designated and identifiable area or 14 to 16 centre for the sole use, when appropriate, of the provision of education and support for 14- to 16-year-olds.

      Inspection-based eligibility criteria
     </h3>
     <p>
      The following inspection-based entry criteria have been established for colleges that wish to enrol 14- to 16-year-olds full-time from September 2016:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       all colleges with an Ofsted grade of 1 (outstanding) and 2 (good) will be eligible to enrol 14- to 16-year-olds and receive EFA funding in respect of those students
      </li>
      <li>
       colleges with an Ofsted overall effectiveness grade 3 assessed before September 2012 (at which time a 3 was satisfactory) will be subject to a further eligibility threshold
       <ul>
        <li>
         these colleges will need to meet the 2014 to 2015 level 3 point score per entry (as published in the 2015
         <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance/" rel="external">
          Department for Education’s (DfE) performance tables
         </a>
         that is equal to or greater than the general further education college average for academic OR vocational qualifications (not both), determined by which constitutes the largest element of provision at the college
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       colleges with an Ofsted grade 3 post September 2012 (requires improvement) will not be eligible to seek to enrol and receive EFA funding for full-time 14- to 16-year-olds, and their level 3 points score will not be taken into account
      </li>
      <li>
       colleges with an Ofsted grade 4 (inadequate) will not be eligible to seek to enrol and receive EFA funding for full time 14- to 16-year-olds
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Colleges with a current Notice to Improve (notice) from either the Chief Executive of the Skills Funding Agency or the EFA for any reason will not be eligible to receive EFA funding for 14- to 16-year-olds enrolled at the college.
     </p>
     <p>
      The EFA will only review college eligibility where they trigger government intervention, or receive a notice for any reason. Should a college receive a notice after funding commences, funding for the existing cohort of students will continue, but the EFA may take such other steps as it deems necessary, including but not limited to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       require the college to accept and comply with additional obligations in relation to the 14 to 16 funding
      </li>
      <li>
       require the college to suspend the further recruitment of 14- to 16-year-olds and/or cap any growth in 14 to 16 student numbers
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The college will be expected to work with Ofsted’s improvement HMI to make the required improvement, which might include its 14 to 16 activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the college’s overall standards drop to a point where government intervention is triggered, all provision (including 14 to 16 delivery) at the college will be subject to review by the FE Commissioner or the Sixth Form College Commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a participating college discontinues 14 to 16 delivery, and there is a break of one academic year or more; should the college wish to re-commence 14 to 16 delivery it will be required to meet the eligibility criteria at the point at which it re-commences that delivery.

     <p>
      Students can only be enrolled with the consent of their parents/carers and the college should retain a record of parental/carer consent. Parents/carers should be advised that they are legally required to notify the previous school that their child will be enrolled in college receiving education other than at school.
     </p>
     <p>
      Parents can get impartial advice, information and support from their local parent partnership about their child’s needs. Details of their local service can be found on the

       national parent partnership network

      website.
     </p>
     <p>
      The EFA will only fund 14 to 16 students enrolled by the college up to and including those recorded on the individualised learner record (known as the ILR) return R04. Any 14- to 16-year-old students enrolled and recorded after this date will not be funded by the EFA. This is because of the nature of the underlying funding mechanism, which involves a recharge to the dedicated schools grant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the college is approached to enrol 14 to 16 students after this point, it should negotiate an appropriate transfer of funding from either the school that the student attended from the start of the academic year, or in the case of 14 to 16 students arriving from overseas, from the relevant local authority.

      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25">
       A new code of practice came in to force in September 2014
      </a>
      which explains the duties of schools and colleges to provide reasonable adjustments for disabled children and young people, and auxilory aids and services to disabled children and young people.
     </p>
     <p>
      This 0-25 SEND Code of Practice applies to colleges. To help colleges, a
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-guide-for-further-education-providers">
       specific further education guide
      </a>
      is available.
     </p>
     <h3 id="high-needs-students">
      High needs students
     </h3>
     <p>
      Colleges should anticipate the special educational needs (SEN) of students as much as possible, working with the feeder school and advance planning with the student and their family. This is the case for students on SEN support as well as those with statements of SEN or education health and care (EHC) plans. Colleges may also undertake assessments themselves to identify the support the student may need, and whether they may need to agree high needs funding with the student’s home local authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      Colleges may enrol high needs students provided they satisfy the requirements in this guide and the following arrangements are in place.
     </p>
     <h3 id="high-needs-students-with-statements-of-sen">
      High needs students with statements of SEN
     </h3>
     <p>
      Where a student has an existing statement of SEN, and where it is agreed that the student will seek to enrol at the college at age 14 or 15, the local authority will contact the college and discuss the placement. It is for the college and the local authority to agree the placement and the high needs funding. The statement of SEN may continue for 14 and 15-year-olds in college, although parents have the right to request an EHC assessment under the
      <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/6/contents/enacted" rel="external">
       Children and Families Act 2014
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      From the 2015 to 2016 academic year, local authorities must assess all students with SEN statements who are making the transition to a post-16 institution with a view to transferring them to EHC plans. So for entry from 2016, all new students in college will have an EHC plan.

     <h3 id="high-needs-students-with-education-health-and-care-plans">
      High needs students with education health and care plans
     </h3>
     <p>
      Where a student has an EHC plan at school, the parent has the right to express a preference for a participating college to be named in the student’s plan. The local authority must consult the college about this, and if the college is named in the plan then the college must admit that student.

      High needs students who do not have a statement or an EHC plan
     </h3>
     <p>
      Colleges should find out from a student’s school about any already identified special educational needs and whether they have been identified as high needs. Where students have been identified already as having high needs, the student’s home local authority should be aware of them, and colleges should ask the local authority for any further information about their needs (they may, for example, have been assessed already for a statement of SEN or an EHC plan, even if they do not have one). The college should seek agreement from the home local authority for a high needs placement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some high needs can be identified after enrolment. Colleges have a duty under the Children and Families Act 2014 to use their best endeavours to meet the special educational needs of their students, including 14 and 15 year-olds. Where, despite the college having taken relevant and purposeful action to identify, assess and meet the needs of the student within its existing budget, the student is still not making expected progress, the college should draw the student to the local authority’s attention, and consider requesting the local authority to conduct an EHC needs assessment.

     </p>
     <p>
      There will be no charge in respect of admission to the college of 14- to 16-year-olds and the college will only charge such students where the law allows maintained schools to charge.

      does not apply to colleges; the college should, unless it is unreasonable to do so, adopt these as a model for expected practice. This should include providing a right to appeal to an independent and impartial appeals panel clerked by someone with a sound understanding of the schools admission appeals code.
     </p>
     <p>
      The college shall work collaboratively with appropriate local authorities both in promoting the college offer to full time 14- to 16-year-olds, and in ensuring appropriate local authorities are made aware, in a timely manner, should an application to enrol be refused or an appeal against a refusal to enrol be unsuccessful.

      Attendance
     </h3>
     <p>
      The college shall work collaboratively with appropriate local authorities in order to share information about the attendance and/or absences (both authorised and unauthorised) as local authorities may deem necessary. Local authorities can then consider if it is necessary to take any action in light of their duties under sections 436A and 437 of the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/children-missing-education">
       Education Act 1996
      </a>
      , which relate to children of compulsory school age who may not be receiving suitable education.
     </p>
     <p>
      Colleges should consider when to authorise an absence. There are some circumstances where a college would have no other option but to authorise an absence. These are when the student is unable to attend:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       because of sickness or unavoidable cause
      </li>
      <li>
       on a day exclusively set apart for religious observance by the religious body to which their parent belongs
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The college will decide when it is appropriate to remove a student from the college roll due to non-attendance. It is recommended that colleges have a policy on attendance that specifies when a student would be removed from roll because of unauthorised absences.
     </p>
     <p>
      This policy should be communicated to parents and the college should send warning letters of its intention to remove the child if no improvements are made within a specified period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before removing a student from the roll because of absence, the college must be satisfied that the absence is not as a result of sickness or any unavoidable cause. The college should inform the relevant local authority immediately if a student is removed from their roll, as well as the grounds for the removal and the student’s contact address. Local authorities must then make alternative provision for the student’s education.
     </p>
     <h3 id="exclusion">
      Exclusion
     </h3>
     <p>
      Legislation and statutory guidance on exclusion apply to: maintained schools; pupil referral units; and Academies/Free Schools (other than 16-19 Academies) and all pupils at these schools, including those who are above or below compulsory school age, for example where a school also has a nursery or a 6th form. The exclusion legislation and guidance do not, however, apply to independent schools (other than Academies), stand-alone sixth form colleges, stand-alone nurseries and other post-16 provision, such as FE colleges, which have their own exclusion arrangements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The exclusions policy of the college for full time 14- to 16-year-olds may wish to use the

       legislation and statutory guidance
      </a>
      as they apply to maintained schools as best practice. The college exclusion policy shall be published in a manner accessible to students and parents.
     </p>
     <p>
      The college shall work collaboratively with the appropriate local authority, in a timely manner, in relation to all forms of exclusion that may be used in respect of students aged 14 to 16, notifying them of all exclusions and keeping a record of such exclusions. Where a 14- to 16-year-old student is to be excluded for more than 5 days or permanently then the local authority and the local authority where the pupil resides will be notified without delay, on the same day that the decision to exclude is taken. This is to ensure that the relevant local authority is aware of its duty to provide education to pupils of compulsory school age who would not otherwise receive it.

     <h3 id="block-1-economic-deprivation-funding">
      Block 1: economic deprivation funding
     </h3>
     <p>
      Block 1 funding recognises that there are additional costs incurred in engaging, recruiting, and retaining young people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Whether a learner is eligible for block 1 funding is determined by their home postcode and the level of deprivation recorded in the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015">
       English Indices of Deprivation 2015

     </p>
     <p>
      For 16 to 19 funding block 1 also gives an additional amount of funding for students who are in or have recently left care. This is not applicable for 14- to 16-year-olds as those students who are in or have recently left care will receive pupil premium funding.

     <p>
      Block 2 funding accounts for the additional costs incurred for teaching students who have low prior attainment. However, as most 14 and 15 year-olds will not have started or achieved English and/or mathematics GCSE, the proportion of students eligible for IMD in calculation of block 1 will be used to generate funding for block 2.

     <h3 id="funding-for-high-needs-students">
      Funding for high needs students
     </h3>
     <p>
      The EFA uses the post-16 funding methodology and subsequent funding arrangements for the implementation of the 14 to 16 in FE programme. This includes the implementation of the post-16 methodology to support the recruitment of students with high needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      For funding purposes, a high needs student is defined as a student who requires support for special educational needs (SEN) that costs more than £6,000 and the package of support must have been agreed by the local authority in which the student lives.
     </p>
     <p>
      In all instances, a high needs student’s placement must be commissioned by the local authority and include the top-up funding (element 3) to be paid to an institution. An agreement must be in place between the two parties to that effect. If the local authority does not agree a placement (even where an institution may have assessed a student as requiring additional support or a student has been offered a place by that institution) and top-up funding for a student is not agreed to, these students cannot be counted as high needs for funding purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The principles which apply to post-16 high needs students apply equally to 14- to 16-year-olds directly enrolled in colleges. This means that the EFA will directly fund the student’s programme (Element 1) in-line with the post-16 funding methodology.
     </p>
     <p>
      The EFA will fund students reported by institution in the ILR R04 data return. These student numbers will be used to calculate a deduction to the commissioning local authorities DSG in March. Where students are directly recruited after the R04 submission has been made; we are unable to fund these students directly and request colleges to agree arrangements with the student’s school and obtain funding from them directly.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the college has not used its allocation of element 2 places for post-16 students, this funding can be used to support 14- to 16-year-olds with high needs because element 2 place funding is not reserved for a specific student or local authority. The local authority would then provide top up funding (element 3) as appropriate from its high needs budget.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an institution has filled the element 2 places it has been funded for, agreement needs to be reached with the local authority on the total level of support required. A local authority should not automatically be charged an extra £6,000 per head if it is agreed that the support package for additional students can be met at marginal, rather than full cost for the institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funding for students whose additional support costs are £6,000 or less and who are therefore not high needs students, should be met from the 14 to 16 in FE funding formula (described from paragraph 41 onwards) which provides a pot of disadvantage funding. The calculation of disadvantage funding takes account of student prior attainment and, where relevant, provides extra funding for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

     </p>
     <p>
      They allow colleges to:

       the college shall have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State for Education, further to section 403 Education Act 1996, on sex and relationship education to ensure that 14- to 16-year-olds enrolled at the college are protected from inappropriate teaching materials and they learn the nature of marriage and its importance for family life and for bringing up children. The college shall also have regard to section 405 Education Act 1996

      Free meals
     </h3>
     <p>
      The college shall, if requested to do so by or on behalf of any 14- to 16-year-old student, make provision for meals for those students unless it would be unreasonable for it to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      In relation to a student who is themselves, or whose parents are in receipt of benefits, mentioned in section 512ZB Education Act 1996 (or equivalent provision governing the entitlement to free meals at maintained schools); the college shall ensure that the provision for meals is provided for such students free of charge.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where students are eligible for free meals, these should be provided by the college. The disadvantage element of 14 to 16 programme funding in part reflects the need for colleges to meet the cost of this provision. However, a student is not eligible to receive a free meal until an application has been made by them or on their behalf.
     </p>
     <p>
      To identify which students are eligible for free meals, colleges should contact the parents and carers of their 14- to 16-year-old pupils and ask if they think their child
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-free-school-meals">
       meets the criteria detailed on GOV.UK
      </a>
      . The student, or their parent/guardian, must submit an application to the college. Colleges should develop their own process for dealing with free meals applications. Some may wish to use a paper application form, whilst others may wish to provide an on-line application option.

      The college shall submit a return detailing their pupils eligible for pupil premium and/or service premium to the EFA in December in the prescribed format. The college should retain copies of the evidence seen of entitlement to free school meals for a period of 6 years from the end of the year in which the provision for food was made.
     </p>
     <p>
      The payment of the pupil premium grant is subject to the conditions detailed in these Requirements of Funding and the Pupil Premium Conditions of Funding Grant. For the 2016 to 2017 financial year, colleges will receive a proportion of annual pupil premium grant on or before 31 March 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      From September 2014, participating colleges are required to publish annually information in relation to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the amount of the pupil premium grant it will receive during that financial year
      </li>
      <li>

     <p>
      Children are provided with free transport between home and their nearest suitable school if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a child lives more than three miles from the nearest suitable school.
      </li>
      <li>
       a child is unable to walk because of special educational needs, disability or mobility, or the walking route is unsafe
      </li>
      <li>
       there are additional rights to home to school transport for children whose parents are in receipt of the maximum Working Tax Credit, or are entitled to free meals
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Entitlement to free home to school transport is lost if the student enrols at a college, as colleges are not qualifying schools for transport purposes. Home to school transport is made up of unprotected funding and local taxes and if a pupil is no longer enrolled in a qualifying school then the local authority is no longer obliged to fund their transport. However the local authority may do so if they wish and parents whose children will lose school transport should contact their local authority for advice.

      Careers guidance

     <p>
      The college is required to secure independent careers guidance for all students up to and including the age of 18 (and 19- to 25-year-olds with a current Learning Difficulty Assessment in place under section 139a of the
      <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/21/contents" rel="external">

       Children and Families Act 2014
      </a>
      . Independent careers guidance secured under the requirement should:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       inspire and inform young people about the full range of education training, and employment opportunities available to students
      </li>

      <li>
       promote the best interests of the student to whom it is given
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Colleges should review existing support and take steps to ensure this meets the needs of their 14- to 16-year-old students. They should also check that the young person has received sufficiently robust information, advice and guidance prior to commencing at college to ensure they are following the most appropriate learning pathway.

      Performance measures and intervention
     </h3>
     <p>
      Once students are enrolled at a college, that provision will be subject to Ofsted inspection. The provision for 14- to 16-year-olds will be inspected under the Common Inspection Framework. Ofsted guidance sets out the detail of
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-and-skills-inspection-handbook-from-september-2015">
       how its inspection arrangements will cover enrolled provision for 14- to 16-year-olds
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The EFA’s Funding Agreement with colleges reflects the DfE’s policy on accountability and intervention. A college in receipt of funds from EFA is expected to be aware of most recent DFE policy requirements as they relate to all the young people it provides for.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that a college is identified as underperforming in relation to its provision for full time enrolled 14- to 16-year-olds, the EFA may take action in accordance with the provisions in the Funding Agreement. Underperformance may be identified through inspection or, when data becomes available, through the application of any national minimum or floor standards that relate to this cohort. Subject to the extent of that underperformance further recruitment of 14- to 16-year-olds may be suspended or ceased.
     </p>
     <p>
      The first performance data relating to the 14 to 16 cohort was published in the Key Stage 4 2015 performance tables in January 2016 and shows the performance of the first 14 to 16 cohort who sat their Key Stage 4 examinations in the 2014 to 2015 academic year. The Key Stage 4 floor standard will be applied to those student outcomes. For reference, the current Key Stage 4 floor standard states that schools are below the floor, if fewer than 40% of students achieve five or more GCSEs at A* - C or equivalent including GCSEs (or iGCSEs) in both English and mathematics, and students make below average expected progress in English and mathematics.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the 2015 to 2016 academic year, the floor standard will be based on Progress 8. If a college’s performance falls below this floor standard, then the college may come under scrutiny through inspection. The Progress 8 guidance published on GOV.UK provides specific details on how Progress 8 is calculated – this includes worked examples and diagrams.  For those colleges that trigger intervention for any of the reasons set out in this document, or in the Funding Agreement, the EFA (in the case of sixth-form colleges) and the Chief Executive of Skills Funding and/or the FE Commissioner (for general further education colleges) will act in accordance with the provisions set out in the relevant Funding Agreement and any applicable policy. The 14 to 16 delivery will be an important, but proportionate, consideration as part of that intervention process.

      Publication of Information

     <p>
      Where applicable, participating colleges will ensure that the following information for the 2014/15 academic year is published on the college’s website as and when it becomes available:
