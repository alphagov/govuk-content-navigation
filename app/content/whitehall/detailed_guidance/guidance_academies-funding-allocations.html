      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      We calculate most of an academy’s revenue funding using the pupil numbers taken from either the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/school-census">
       autumn census return
      </a>
      or an agreed estimate of pupil numbers, as outlined in the academy’s funding agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Academies funded on estimates may be subject to the pupil number adjustment process; visit our
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funded-on-estimates">
       academies funded on estimates page
      </a>
      for more information.
     </p>
     <p>
      We used pupil numbers recorded in the October 2015 census to calculate funding for the 2016 to 2017 academic year. We will use pupil numbers recorded in the October 2016 census to calculate funding for the 2017 to 2018 academic year.
     </p>
     <p>
      We use the local authority formula to calculate mainstream provision, and place-led funding for pupils who attract high needs funding. Academies and free schools also receive the education services grant (
      <abbr title="education services grant">
       ESG
      </abbr>
      ), which covers the cost of services local authorities provide directly to maintained schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each local authority agrees the funding factors and rates for their area in consultation with their
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/schools-forum-a-guide-for-schools-and-academies">
       schools forum
      </a>
      . The funding formula for mainstream academies uses pupil-led factors such as basic entitlement, deprivation, prior attainment, mobility and English as an additional language (
      <abbr title="English as an additional language">
       EAL
      </abbr>
      ), combined with factors based on the institution, such as a lump sum for premises costs, split site funding or a sparsity factor for small rural academies.
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      uses the local funding model to calculate allocations for academies and free schools.

     </h2>
     <p>
      Most funding for academies comes from the general annual grant (
      <abbr title="general annual grant">
       GAG
      </abbr>
      ). This is made up of:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       school budget share – calculated on the same basis as for maintained schools in the same local authority. The
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funding-allocation-pack-2016-to-2017-academic-year">
        FAP guidance for the 2016 to 2017 academic year
       </a>
       explains how we calculate the school budget share.

      <li>
       education services grant (

        ESG
       </abbr>
       ) – allocated based on pupil numbers
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A minimum funding guarantee protects the school budget share. This means per-pupil funding will not fall by more than 1.5% compared with the previous year. The minimum funding guarantee calculation excludes funding for sixth forms and places in special units.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where appropriate, the
      <abbr title="general annual grant">
       GAG
      </abbr>
      may also include funding for high needs places, post-16 students and startup funding for new institutions.
