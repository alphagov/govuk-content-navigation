      We calculate most of an academy’s revenue funding using the pupil numbers taken from either the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/school-census">
       autumn census return
      </a>
      or an agreed estimate of pupil numbers, as outlined in the academy’s funding agreement. Institutions funded on estimates may be subject to a pupil number adjustment. Visit our
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funded-on-estimates">
       academies funded on estimates page
      </a>
      for more information. We used pupil numbers recorded in the October 2015 census to calculate funding for the 2016 to 2017 academic year.
     </p>
     <p>
      We use the local authority (
      <abbr title="local authority">
       LA
      </abbr>
      ) formula to calculate mainstream provision, and place-led funding for pupils who attract high-needs funding. Academies and free schools also receive the education services grant (
      <abbr title="education services grant">
       ESG
      </abbr>
      ), which covers the cost of services
      <abbr title="local authorities">
       LAs
      </abbr>
      provide directly to maintained schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each

      agrees the funding factors and rates for their area in consultation with their
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/schools-forum-a-guide-for-schools-and-academies">
       schools forum
      </a>
      . The funding formula for mainstream academies uses pupil-led factors such as basic entitlement, deprivation, prior attainment, mobility and English as an additional language (
      <abbr title="English as an additional language">
       EAL
      </abbr>
      ), combined with factors based on the institution, such as a lump sum for premises costs, split site funding or a sparsity factor for small rural academies.

      Most funding for academies comes from the general annual grant (
      <abbr title="general annual grant">
       GAG
      </abbr>
      ). This is made up of:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       school budget share – calculated on the same basis as for maintained schools in the same
       <abbr title="local authority">

      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A minimum funding guarantee protects the school budget share. This means per-pupil funding will not fall by more than 1.5% compared with the previous year. The minimum funding guarantee calculation excludes funding for sixth forms and places in special units.

     <p>
      Where appropriate, the
