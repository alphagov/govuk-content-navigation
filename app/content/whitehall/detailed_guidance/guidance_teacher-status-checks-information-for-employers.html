      You can claim individuals employed by your school or sixth form college. They’ll then be included on your own list of teachers. This allows you to regularly check the teachers you employ without needing to re-enter their details.

     <p>
      If they move to new employment, you can disown them and they’ll be removed from your list of teachers.
     </p>
     <p>
      By doing this, the individual’s employment history is maintained on our database of teachers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Teachers can’t be claimed by more than one employer. As supply teachers can choose to register with a number of supply agency organisations, this function isn’t available to supply agencies.
