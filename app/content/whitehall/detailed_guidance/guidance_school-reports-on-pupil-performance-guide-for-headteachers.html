      You must send a written report to parents on their child’s progress for the school year by the end of each summer term.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where information is not available before the end of the summer term (in the case of national curriculum assessment results), you must send it to parents as soon as possible, and no later than within 15 school days of receiving it. The report for school leavers must be sent no later than 30 September following the end of the school year in which the pupil left.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can split the report across the academic year, for example to report on each term separately.
