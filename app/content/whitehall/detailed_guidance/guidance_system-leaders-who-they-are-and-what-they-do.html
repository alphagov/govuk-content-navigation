     </p>
     <p>
      There are now many opportunities for school leaders and governors to work with and receive support from their peers. This guide summarises the options available to you and how to access them.

      This will vary considerably, depending on how much support your school needs. Some projects only take a few days, others can include full-time support roles over a period of several years. Your school, the teaching school, and any concerned organisations (for example, Ofsted or the local authority) will negotiate this.
