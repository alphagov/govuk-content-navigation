       One of the most effective ways of achieving school improvement is by working with other schools.

       There are now many opportunities for school leaders and governors to work with and receive support from their peers. This guide summarises the options available to you and how to access them.

      <p>
       Teaching schools have an important role to play in a school-led system and in school improvement.  Teaching schools will be centres of excellence, taking on a more focused role that prioritises:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         co-ordinating and delivering high quality school-based initial teacher training (
         <abbr title="initial teacher training">
          ITT
         </abbr>
         )
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Providing high quality school-to-school support to spread excellent practice, particularly to schools that need it most
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Providing evidence-based professional and leadership development for teachers and leaders across their network
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In addition, teaching schools can play a role as brokerage hubs for other system leaders, co-ordinating the supply and activity of national leaders of education (
       <abbr title="national leaders of education">
        NLEs
       </abbr>
       ), national leaders of governance (
       <abbr title="national leaders of governance">
        NLGs
       </abbr>
       ) and specialist leaders of education (
       <abbr title="specialist leaders of education">
        SLEs
       </abbr>
       ). They help prevent underperformance by supporting vulnerable schools, and where needed, help tackle underperformance in coasting schools and lead improvement in good schools.

Your school, the teaching school, and any concerned organisations (for example, Ofsted or the local authority) will negotiate this.

       Pupil Premium Reviews
      </h2>
      <p>
       A pupil premium review looks at how a school is spending its pupil premium funding. As a reviewer, system leaders will work with you to improve your school’s pupil premium strategy so the funding is spent on approaches shown to be effective in improving the achievement of disadvantaged pupils. They will carry out a focused review of your school’s current provision and work with you to put in place an improved strategy, including planned spend, on specific evidence-based approaches.

       The
       <abbr title="National College for Teaching and Leadership">
        NCTL
       </abbr>
       designates system leaders as pupil premium reviewers. Reviewers have a track record in making a difference with disadvantaged pupils. These system leaders are responsible for the delivery of an effective review, and will usually hold an initial discussion with the head teacher of the commissioning school. Beyond this, reviewers may deploy other members of their leadership team with expertise in this area, including middle leaders and
       <abbr title="specialist leaders of education">
        SLEs
       </abbr>
       , to lead aspects of the review.

      <h3 id="costs-4">
       Costs
      </h3>
      <p>
       Commissioning schools or academy trusts pay for their pupil premium review. The cost is a matter for agreement between your and the commissioning school / academy trust, but should reflect the amount of time involved. There is no set cost for a review and the DfE and
       <abbr title="National College for Teaching and Leadership">

       </abbr>
       have no set day rates for system leaders, but as a guide, day rates should reflect pay and expenses for a senior leader or headteacher, including the costs incurred by their school to release them. A typical day rate for a system leader is currently between £300 and £500.

       An effective pupil premium review will usually take between two and four days. This includes a day spent by your school undertaking self-evaluation, and a half-day follow-up visit. Reviewed schools have attested to the value of further follow-up visits later in the year, once changes have had time to bed in.

       Teaching Schools Council
      </h2>
      <p>
       The Teaching Schools Council plays a key role in ensuring every child in every part of the country has access to a good school. It does this by working with regional and national partners to ensure high quality
       <abbr title="initial teacher training">
        ITT
       </abbr>
       , high quality professional and leadership development opportunities and effective school-to-school support.
      </p>
      <p>
       Teaching Schools Council representatives work with regional schools commissioners to help deliver school improvement on the ground, and with other agencies such as Ofsted, local authorities and dioceses. The Teaching Schools Council has a national strategic presence complemented by local partnerships that can draw in wider resources such as
       <abbr title="national leaders of education">
        NLEs
       </abbr>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The Teaching Schools Council is made up of 17 representatives, all of whom are serving school leaders of designated teaching schools (CEOs of MATs, executive heads, headteachers or directors of teaching schools). All representatives have both a regionally and nationally facing role. There are 2 peer representatives who contribute to support the work of the Teaching Schools Council.

       Teaching Schools Council regional networks

      <p>
       The Teaching Schools Council regional representatives have recently developed regional and sub-regional networks to enable coherent and effective practice for school based
       <abbr title="initial teacher training">
        ITT
       </abbr>
       , evidence-based professional development and school-to-school support. Teaching Schools Council regional representatives and their networks provide essential support to all teaching school alliances and system leaders including supporting the brokerage of support particularly to schools that need it most. They work collaboratively with other key players in the regions, including regional schools commissioners, Ofsted, local authorities and dioceses to help deliver school improvement on the ground and ensure effective communication links across the regions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each network will support newly designated teaching school alliances particularly in their first few weeks of designation, providing an overview of regional teaching school activity and key priorities. Further support can be provided to help new alliances consider their governance structures and arrangements to enable effective delivery against priorities. Teaching Schools Council regional representatives will contact new alliances at the regional induction event with an expectation that they will join the regional network.
