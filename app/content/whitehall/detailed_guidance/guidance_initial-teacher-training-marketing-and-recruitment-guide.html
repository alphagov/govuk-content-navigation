     <ul>
      <li>
       be aware that many applicants are entering the system for the first time and may be selecting you as their first choice

      The autumn term is crucial, both in terms of planning and preparation. Applications get off to a strong start once the
      <abbr title="The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">
       UCAS
      </abbr>
      teacher training system opens, so:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       define your offer (career packages, financial incentives, range of experience, qualifications, etc)
      </li>
      <li>
       make sure everyone at your school and your partner organisations know why an applicant would choose to train with you
      </li>
      <li>
       ensure your website and
       <abbr title="The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">

       </abbr>
       teacher training has opened – encourage them to visit and apply to you
      </li>
      <li>
       plan how you’ll make offers early to secure your first-choice applicants, for example, a planned induction; a tailored career package; experience in partner school
      </li>
      <li>
       attend events – sign up for our
       <a href="http://traintoteach.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">

      </li>
     </ul>

      Interviews start:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       agree in advance exactly what you’re looking for and the levels you expect from the applicant, such as commitment; communication; subject knowledge; and school experience
      </li>
      <li>
       decide where you’re willing to add value to applicants who show the most promise and potential so that you don’t lose them, for example subject knowledge enhancement (
       <abbr title="subject knowledge enhancement">
        SKE
       </abbr>
       ) or further school experience
      </li>
      <li>
       consider where and when you’ll hold interviews with your partner provider – could you vary the school location to cover any rural schools in your partnership?
      </li>
      <li>
       schedule your recruitment year before you start interviews – give successful candidates dates of catch-ups or inductions in advance
      </li>
      <li>
       discuss subject knowledge and professional skills tests at interview, encourage applicants to take these early and consider how you can support them

     <h2 id="plan-your-marketing">
      Plan your marketing
     </h2>
     <p>
      Research your area. Your knowledge of the size, nature and location of your local area and the way you fit into this should inform your plan. You should also take into account broader teacher recruitment factors. For example, urban areas tend to attract more graduate applicants than rural so you need to base your approach on your area.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should plan ahead and decide how to promote your places and what deadlines there are. Your marketing plan should include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       clear objectives
      </li>
      <li>
       activities
      </li>
      <li>
       success measures
      </li>
      <li>
       timings
      </li>
      <li>
       budget
      </li>
      <li>
       resources
      </li>
      <li>
       contingency plans, for example:
       <ul>
        <li>
         changes to staffing
        </li>
        <li>
         continuing to recruit through holiday periods to fill places

     <p>
      This is often the first place candidates will look, so make sure it has all the information about the places you have available, and a named contact and number. Ensure that all your partners also signpost your programme on their websites and vice versa: working together to help fill places. Where possible, establish links with university departments and career services, and keep them updated on how many places you have and when you fill them, so they can keep their own sites up to date.

      Website tips:

       <abbr title="initial teacher training">

      <li>
       if you offer

       </abbr>
       to your applicants, say so clearly upfront
      </li>
      <li>
       make sure your content is clear, easy to understand and up-to-date
      </li>
      <li>

       information and your offer is appealing to candidates

       provide at least 1 contact name and details for
       <abbr title="initial teacher training">
        ITT
       </abbr>
       queries
      </li>
      <li>
       provide a direct link to your training places on the

        UCAS
       </abbr>
       training system to make their journey easier
      </li>
      <li>
       include any deadlines, dates or details of events, and how to register to attend
      </li>
      <li>
       promote your Twitter and Facebook accounts
      </li>
      <li>
       signpost who you’re working with in your partnership (higher education institutions (HEIs) and schools)
      </li>
      <li>
       promote that you offer applicants school experience and which

      Your brand
     </h3>
     <p>
      Let candidates know what you can offer them. Be clear about who you are and who is in your partnership.
     </p>
     <p>
      It’s important to present your offer, and your brand clearly to attract and retain interest. It can be confusing for candidates when they’re looking for training and they come across different information and contacts, who are all working together. Sometimes, school-centred initial teacher training (SCITTS), teaching school alliances and School Direct partnerships often have different titles/names to the school they would be interested in training at. If you have a logo, use it on all your channels, including your website, posters, advertisements, letterhead and email signatures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Explain to your colleagues the importance of brand. When responding to enquiries, ensure colleagues are well-briefed to answer enquiries from potential candidates and make a note of where people found out about your programme - this can help you to evaluate your marketing activities and plan for next year. Keep in touch with them, reinforcing the benefits of studying with you.
     </p>
     <h3 id="manage-enquiries">
      Manage enquiries
     </h3>
     <p>
      Record details of all enquiries, including where people have found out about your programme. Candidates have a lot to think about, so it’s worth contacting them following enquiries, events or visits. This will reinforce the benefits of studying with you and provide ongoing support with their application. You can also use this information to inform your future marketing activities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Focus on the unique benefits of training with you:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the expectation of employment
      </li>
      <li>
       finance available (salary, scholarships or bursaries)
      </li>
      <li>
       practical, school-based training
      </li>
      <li>
       career packages with further training and development and progression opportunities
      </li>
      <li>
       quality – let them know if you’re an outstanding school
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Let candidates know:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       what they need to do next and by when (advertising deadlines motivates candidates to action)
      </li>
      <li>
       who to contact or where to go for more information (your website)
      </li>
     </ul>

      Career changers
     </h3>
     <p>
      The School Direct training programme (salaried) is mainly aimed at graduates with 3 or more years’ career experience and is an attractive route into teaching for career changers. When planning your marketing, ensure you consider the different needs of this important audience.
     </p>
     <p>
      Career changers may be:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       looking for a greater sense of fulfilment from a new career
      </li>
      <li>
       worrying about the financial cost of training and facing a decreased income throughout their early years of teaching
      </li>
      <li>
       juggling other commitments, such as parenting or caring responsibilities
      </li>
      <li>
       less likely to have a peer group considering a similar step
      </li>
      <li>
       more in need of school experience or subject knowledge enhancement
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Your campaign should:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       use messages that emphasise the softer, more altruistic rewards of being a teacher
      </li>
      <li>
       focus on career and salary progression rather than starting salaries
      </li>
      <li>
       set out the relative merits of bursaries and scholarships against the salary they can earn on the School Direct (salaried) route
      </li>
      <li>
       use messages, such as “1 in 3 of our trainee teachers is a career changer like you”, and case studies
compare bursaries and scholarships to a post-tax income
      </li>
      <li>
       highlight the support you can give them to help them make the move into teaching, including school experience and subject knowledge enhancement courses

      Staying in touch with candidates is simple and can have a big impact on them feeling connected to you before they’ve started their course. You could:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       if you’re in a teaching school alliance with specialist leaders of education in
       <abbr title="initial teacher training">

       , use them to buddy accepted
       <abbr title="initial teacher training">
        ITT
       </abbr>
       candidates
      </li>
      <li>
       ask your relevant head of department or subject lead to be the main contact for your candidate and make them feel like they’re already part of your school
      </li>
      <li>
       appoint a mentor or buddy for each candidate to offer tutoring or group support (for example, a newly qualified teacher or recently qualified teacher)
      </li>
      <li>
       invest in administrative support to speak to candidates and answer their queries (this person could also be in charge of ensuring the relevant paperwork is completed and the candidate has everything they need to start the course)
      </li>
      <li>
       send your staff bulletins and school newsletters to candidates to let them know what’s going on at the school
      </li>
      <li>
       invite candidates to school events and meetings (for example, continuing professional development sessions, recruitment events, lesson observations and sports days)
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="prepare-them-for-school-life">
      Prepare them for school life
     </h3>
     <p>
      Candidates should have some school experience, but it may not have been within your school, take time to introduce them to your school and their course. You could:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       link them to a host school as soon as possible, even for fee paying candidates, candidates want to be able to identify with a particular school
      </li>
      <li>
       invite them to spend time working in their future subject departments, getting to know colleagues, students and the curriculum
      </li>
      <li>
       set candidates a series of preparation tasks each month which are linked to the school and their subject area (these can be monitored and used to develop an individual learning plan and gives candidates the feeling that they’re already progressing)
      </li>
      <li>
       use vacant teaching assistant positions to employ candidates as a paid incentive to become involved in the school prior to training
      </li>
      <li>
       send reading lists and subject specialist information to candidates for them to look at before starting
      </li>
      <li>
       ask them to come into school and help with preparing events
      </li>

     <p>
      You may want to encourage a feeling of community between candidates by:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       setting up online communities for new candidates through social media so they can get to know each other before meeting face-to-face
      </li>
      <li>
       setting up cohort training sessions (for example, to help them pass their skills test)
      </li>
     </ul>

      Some candidates might be eligible for a scholarship. Make sure they’re aware of the financial incentives available to them and, if appropriate, support them in applying.
     </p>
     <p>
      Let candidates know what to expect, not only from their training but from a life of teaching. Teaching is one of the most fulfilling and rewarding professions a person can choose.

      nationally. To get coverage in your local press:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       take a look at our

       to help get your advert into the local press
      </li>
      <li>
       think of unique angles for your school or institution – this might include a notice to say:
       <ul>
        <li>
         your applications have opened
        </li>
        <li>
         you’re hosting an event

        <li>
         you’ve had a large number of applications

        </li>

       the local press like stories about people – share case studies or consider a story about your first appointed trainee

      <li>
       consider having discussions on student radio about the benefits of becoming a teacher
