         The full criteria for special consideration applications from schools is available at key stage 2 tests:

         Schools received their pupils’ results on 5 July 2016 via
         <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/Home.aspx" rel="external">
          NCA tools
         </a>
         . Results include the total raw score achieved for each pupil, in each subject, and the corresponding scaled score. The
         <a href="https://www-origin.staging.publishing.service.gov.uk/guidance/scaled-scores-at-key-stage-2">
          raw score to scaled score conversion tables
         </a>
         are available for reference.
        </p>
        <p>
         Results reflect each pupil’s actual attainment in the tests, including those pupils who have had an application for special consideration approved.
        </p>
        <p>
         The scaled scores won’t be adjusted, but there will be a ‘+’ sign on the return of results website, to show that special consideration has been granted. The outcome field will show ‘CA’ (consideration applied) instead of either ‘AS’ (achieved the expected standard) or ‘NS’ (not achieved the expected standard).
        </p>
        <p>
         The scaled score reported on
         <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/Home.aspx" rel="external">
          NCA tools
         </a>
         will show if the pupil met the expected standard in the test before special consideration was applied. A scaled score of 100 will represent the expected standard on the test. Pupils scoring 100 or more will have demonstrated that they met the expected standard.
        </p>

        <p>
         As adjusted scaled scores are not being reported to schools on the return of results website, schools should consider how they report the test results to parents where special consideration has been granted.
        </p>
        <p>
         Schools should consider a pupil’s individual circumstances which led to the application for special consideration, as well as how representative the test results are of the pupil’s abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Schools should use their teacher assessment judgements and any other in-school formative assessment when reporting a pupil’s achievements to parents at the end of the summer term.

        <p>
         While special consideration does not give us sufficient information to change a pupil’s scaled score itself, we will take into account the fact that special consideration has been granted when calculating school performance measures published in December.
        </p>
        <p>
         When calculating primary school performance measures, a number of points will be added to pupils’ scaled scores if special consideration has been granted. These adjusted scaled scores will be used only to calculate the school’s performance measures. This will apply to both attainment and progress measures.
        </p>
        <p>
         The number of scaled score points that will be added for each subject are as follows:
        </p>
        <table>
         <thead>
          <tr>
           <th>
            Test
           </th>
           <th>
            Number of points to be added to the scaled score
           </th>
          </tr>
         </thead>
         <tbody>
          <tr>
           <td>
            English reading
           </td>
           <td>
            3
           </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>
            English grammar, punctuation and spelling
           </td>
           <td>
            3
           </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>
            Mathematics
           </td>
           <td>
            3
           </td>
          </tr>
         </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
         Schools can add the number of points to a pupil’s reported scaled score for a test to understand what adjusted scaled score will be used in the performance tables.
        </p>
        <p>
         Adjusted scaled scores will be capped at the maximum score available for a test. For example if a pupil’s scaled score from the test is 118, then a scaled score of 120, the maximum scaled score on the tests, will be used for calculations in the performance tables.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a pupil doesn’t achieve the minimum number of raw score marks needed to be awarded a scaled score, their adjusted scaled score will be set to the minimum scaled score available for the test, 80.
