      We fund sixth-form colleges, further education (FE) colleges, sixth-forms in schools, sixth-forms in academies, special schools, special academies, commercial and charitable providers (
      <abbr title="Commercial and charitable providers">
       CCPs
      </abbr>
      ), local authorities (LAs), special post-16 institutions (SPIs) and some higher education institutions (
      <abbr title="higher education establishments">
       HEIs
      </abbr>
      ). We fund these institutions to provide study programmes for young people.
     </p>
     <p>
      We fund:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       students aged 16 to 19 and
      </li>
      <li>
       students up to the age of 25 when they have an education, health and care (

       14 to 16 year olds who are directly enrolled into eligible FE institutions
      </li>
      <li>
       home educated students of compulsory school age at any FE college
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We use a national funding formula to calculate an allocation of funding to each institution, each academic year.   The national funding formula is not used for special schools and special academies. These institutions are funded on place numbers only.
     </p>
     <p>
      We calculate the basic funding for institutions using national funding rates, which depend on the size of their students’ study programmes. These rates are regardless of which type of institution they study at or what they study. We then apply the other elements of the funding formula, as described below. To attract funding a student must meet the published eligibility criteria, such as residency requirements. These are set out in the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision">
       funding regulations guide for the appropriate academic year
      </a>
      . Students must stay on their study programmes for a certain amount of time to qualify for funding. Further information about qualifying periods is available in the student numbers section.
     </p>
     <p>
      We have produced a video explaining how the funding formula works,

      Funding formula and study programmes
     </h2>
     <p>
      The funding formula funds institutions to deliver study programmes to their students. At enrolment, the institution and the student agree what each student is going to study. A learning agreement/timetable is drawn up showing what the study programme is and the qualification and non-qualification
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-funding-planned-hours-in-study-programmes">
       planned hours
      </a>
      that make up the study programme.
     </p>
     <p>
      The study programme must be tailored to the prior attainment of each student, have clear study and/or employment goals reflecting the student’s prior attainment, show progression in learning, and should include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       substantial qualifications or work experience
      </li>
      <li>

      <li>

     </ul>
     <p>
      Most study programmes have a
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-funding-core-aims-in-study-programmes">
       core aim
      </a>
      . The core aim of a study programme is either a substantial qualification which can be academic or vocational, or work experience. It will usually be the component with the largest amount of timetabled activity associated with it. Study programmes can only have one core aim at a time. Core aims are an essential part of the funding allocations calculation.

      The data used to calculate each element is taken from data returns submitted by institutions. This information is mainly collected via the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ilr-specification-validation-rules-and-appendices-2016-to-2017">
       individualised learner record

       school census
      </a>
      , for schools and academies. Institutions are required to submit regular and accurate data returns to the department.
     </p>
     <p>
      For FE institutions, both the

      The
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/interactive-post-16-school-census-tool">
       post-16 interactive school census tool
      </a>
      has been created to help schools and academies submit accurate autumn census returns. This interactive tool also provides information on how we use the data returned in the autumn census to calculate funding for school and academies.
     </p>
     <p>
      For most post-16 institutions we provide an allocation calculation toolkit (ACT) before the final allocation statements have been issued. This toolkit demonstrates to institutions how we have used their data and the various elements of the funding formula for their organisation.

     <h2 id="student-numbers-element">
      Student numbers element
     </h2>
     <p>
      This is a count of the number of students participating at an institution in the previous academic year. This is known as lagged student numbers.
     </p>
     <p>
      We get the student numbers from either
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-census-2015-to-2016-guide-for-schools-and-las">
       the school census
      </a>

       Individualised Learner Record
      </a>
      (ILR).
     </p>
     <p>
      Student numbers are apportioned into funding bands using historical data. To work out how many students are to be funded in each band, we take the lagged student number and apportion them into bands based on the proportion of students in each band in the most recent year for which we hold full-year data. For example, for 2017 to 2018 allocations, the total number of students is derived from 2016 to 2017 autumn data returns and these are divided into bands based on the distribution in 2015 to 2016. Further information about funding bands is explained in the national funding rates section.
     </p>
     <p>
      To attract funding, students need to complete a qualifying period. For a full time student this is 6 weeks, and for a part time student it can be either 2 or 6 weeks depending on the length of the programme. The table below shows the qualifying periods for study programmes of different lengths.

     <p>
      Adjustments are made to account for different enrolment patterns. For example, for some institutions who enrol students throughout the year, we use student numbers from a rolling 12-month period from February to the next January.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the above approaches are not appropriate, the number of funded students is taken from the latest full year’s data. For institutions where this applies, for the 2017 to 2018 allocations, for example, we use 2015 to 2016 data.
     </p>
     <p>
      New institutions are usually funded on a proportion of the institution’s full capacity, or on the estimated number of students to be recruited in the first year. There are also
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">
       exceptions to the lagged approach

      where there is closing provision or a transfer of provision.

      The funding rate for each student is determined by the size of their study programme based on their planned hours.

     <p>
      All 16 and 17 year old full time students are funded at the same national funding rate per student, per year. The funding rate can vary between academic years.

      Retention factor, programme cost weighting and disadvantage elements
     </h2>
     <p>
      These elements of the funding formula are based on historic data based on the latest full year. For example, to calculate 2017 to 2018 allocations, data from the end of 2015 to 2016 academic year is used.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where there is no historic data, for example when the institution is new, we use averages for a similar type of institution.
     </p>
     <h3 id="retention">
      Retention
     </h3>
     <p>
      The retention factor recognises the number of students who are continuing on their programme or are “retained” to their anticipated end date. Each student who remains in learning to the planned end date of their study programme, or who is recorded as completed or continuing, gets full funding. Each student who is not retained attracts 50% of the full funding rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      When an institution records a student’s
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-funding-core-aims-in-study-programmes#study-programmes">
       core aim
      </a>
      as completed, but the student has finished the core aim early, the student is considered to be retained.
     </p>
     <p>
      An institution where a lot of students withdraw will have a low retention rate and therefore will get less funding in future. For example, a 90% retention rate would result in a retention factor of 0.95, meaning funding would be reduced by 5% when it is applied in the allocation.
     </p>
     <h3 id="programme-cost-weighting">
      Programme cost weighting
     </h3>
     <p>
      Programme cost weighting relates to the cost of delivery of different subjects, and is based on the core aim’s sector subject area (SSA) tier 2 classification.
     </p>
     <p>
      A list of programme cost weightings for 2016 to 2017 is given in the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">
       funding rates and formula guidance
      </a>
      for that year. There are no changes to these weightings in 2017 to 2018. The funding rates and formula guidance for 2017 to 2018 will be published in April 2017.
     </p>
     <h3 id="disadvantage-funding">
      Disadvantage funding
     </h3>
     <p>
      Disadvantage funding is made up of 2 blocks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Disadvantage Block 1 provides funds to support students from areas of economic deprivation based on the index of multiple deprivation (IMD). We use IMD 2015 for this - that is the latest version of the index, released in September 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      Disadvantage Block 2 provides funds for the additional costs incurred for supporting the learning of students who have not achieved A* to C in maths and/or English by year 11.
     </p>
     <p>
      From the academic year 2017 to 2018, the data source used to calculate block 2 funding is being changed, following consultation with the sector. We are using the latest full year’s data from the ILR and school census to calculate block 2. For example, to calculate 2017 to 2018 block 2 funding, data from the end of 2015 to 2016 academic year is used. This reduces the lag from 3 years to 2 years and brings disadvantage block 2 in line with other factors used to calculate allocations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Previously, the data source used to calculate this factor was the Young Persons Matched Administrative Dataset (YPMAD).
     </p>
     <p>
      Disadvantage funding is not ring fenced. This means institutions are free to use this element of the funding to choose the best way to attract, retain and support disadvantaged students and those with learning difficulties and disabilities.

      <li>
       large TechBacc
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The uplift for 2017 to 2018 is  calculated using data from 2014 to 2015. There are 2 levels of uplift: 10% and 20% of the national rate per student. Institutions will receive the uplift for 2 years giving them either £800 or £1,600 additional funding per student.
     </p>
     <h2 id="area-cost-allowance-element">
      Area cost allowance element
     </h2>
     <p>
      The cost of education in London and parts of the South East is higher than in the rest of England, due to the cost of premises and maintenance, staff costs etc. We give institutions in these parts of England additional funding through the area cost uplift. The area cost uplift varies from 20% to 1%. Outside London and the South East the area cost uplift is not applied.

We committed to provide FPF until at least 2015 to 2016. From 2016 to 2017 we have begun to phase it out and the last FPF payments will be made to institutions in 2020 to 2021.
