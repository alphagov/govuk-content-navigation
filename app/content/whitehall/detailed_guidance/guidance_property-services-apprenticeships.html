     <p>
      As a property services apprentice, you are likely to start out in a customer services role in an estate agent’s office advising people on available properties, arranging appointments and viewings, helping market properties and putting customers in touch with people who can help during the house-buying process.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large part of your work will be in residential sales or lettings. However, depending on your agency, you could also deal with commercial property, property management, auctions and selling land.
     </p>
     <p>
      Buying a house is the biggest purchase most of us will make in our lives. Estate agents and lettings agents do a serious job and must understand legal issues as well as commercial ones.

     <p>
      On the advanced apprenticeship you will get more involved with the different areas of selling properties. These include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       obtaining instructions from clients
      </li>
      <li>
       invoicing for fees.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      On the lettings side you will be responsible for:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       compiling legal documentation
      </li>
      <li>
       seeking references
      </li>
      <li>
       handing over keys to new tenants.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Whether you are finding properties for house-buyers, tenants or valuing a property for sale or letting, you will need:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       good knowledge of the property market
      </li>
      <li>
       a professional attitude
      </li>
      <li>
       people skills.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Much of the work will be ‘out and about’ and dealing with people face-to-face, as well as on the telephone.
