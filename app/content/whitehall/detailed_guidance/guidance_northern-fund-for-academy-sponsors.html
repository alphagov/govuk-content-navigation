      This competition for the northern fund (
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-george-osbornes-autumn-statement-2014-speech#northern-powerhouse">
       announced in 2014

      ) gives academy trusts the chance to apply for extra funding that will allow them to take on more schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is a separate competition to the one we ran in January 2016, which was for sponsors setting up new academy hubs. If you applied for the January competition and you also want us to consider you for this competition, you must submit a separate application.
     </p>
     <p>
      We expect to give successful applicants of this competition a one-off payment of typically:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       £25,000 for trusts made up of 1 or 2 schools
      </li>
      <li>
       £50,000 to £100,000 for trusts made up of 3 or more schools
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Please be aware, however, that we haven’t yet finalised the total funding available for this competition.
