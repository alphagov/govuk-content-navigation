      If you’re a maintained school that wishes to get or change a religious designation, you must first close your existing school. You must then approach your local authority with a proposal to open a new school with a religious designation.
     </p>
     <p>
      If your local authority agrees with your proposal, you need to
      <a href="#application">
       apply to get the Secretary of State’s approval
      </a>
      before you open a new school with a religious designation.
     </p>

      If you’re a diocese that wishes to open a maintained school with a religious designation, you should approach your local authority and propose a new voluntary-aided (
      <abbr title="volutary aided">
       VA
      </abbr>
      ) school with a religious character. Your local authority will ask you to show evidence that there’s enough local demand for the school you’re proposing.

      If your local authority agrees with your proposal, you need to
      <a href="#application">

      Prepare your application to get or change a religious designation
     </h3>
     <p>
      You need the Secretary of State for Education’s approval before you can get or change a religious designation. To apply for approval, you must have:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       published a proposal to open a new school with a religious character (eg on your or your local authority’s website)
      </li>
      <li>
       approval from your diocesan authority, if the application is for a Church of England or Roman Catholic school
      </li>
      <li>
       a trust deed (ie the terms relating to the ownership of the premises on behalf of the diocese or religious body) and instrument of government that are consistent with the proposal to open the new school - read
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/constitution-of-governing-bodies-of-maintained-schools">
        guidance for schools on creating their instrument of government
       </a>
      </li>
      <li>
       a proposed governing body for the new school
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      You’ll also need to confirm at least 1 of the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       that at least 1 school governor will be a ‘foundation governor’, ie a governor that your faith authority has appointed to represent the religion of your new school
      </li>
      <li>
       that the governing body will hold the school’s premises on trust (ie on behalf of the diocese or religious body) so that if the school closes, money from the sale of the premises will go to the school’s diocese or religious body
      </li>
      <li>
       that the governing body will hold the school’s premises on trust to provide education according to the school’s religion
