      You’ll have the choice of focusing on either telecoms or IT. Telecoms covers broadband, mobile phones and satellite communications. It’s a fast-moving sector so you should have a keen interest in new technology. You’ll learn things like:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       customer care
      </li>
      <li>
       system security
      </li>
      <li>
       managing software development
      </li>
      <li>
       basic IT applications
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      As an intermediate level apprentice you could work as a support technician setting up new equipment or upgrading existing systems, or as a helpdesk professional working with customers to identify, troubleshoot and escalate IT faults.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the advanced level apprenticeship you could work as a software developer creating software applications and websites, or as a software tester, testing applications before they are released.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a higher apprentice you could work as an IT project manager overseeing the development of customer systems to meet a client’s business needs, or you could work as a network or telecoms manager, managing network growth and development, and supervising technical staff.
