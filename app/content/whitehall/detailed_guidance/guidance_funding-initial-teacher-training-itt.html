      SKE courses can be offered to potential trainees to bring their subject knowledge up to the level required to begin training to teach their chosen subject. Courses can vary from an 8-week refresher course up to a 36-week programme, depending on the individual needs of the applicant.

      Financial requirements for providers
     </h2>
     <p>
      ITT providers who receive NCTL funding must submit independently audited accounts each year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The financial statements must confirm that funds provided by NCTL were used only in accordance with the provision of the Education Act 1994 (as amended by the Education Act 2005 Act), the financial memorandum and all other terms and conditions that NCTL has set. All ITT providers are ultimately responsible to NCTL for the proper stewardship of the funds paid to them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Specific requirements set out in the financial memorandum are that providers shall:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       keep proper accounting records and prepare accounts that are consistent with NCTL requirements
      </li>
      <li>
       submit a copy of their accounts to NCTL
      </li>
      <li>
       provide NCTL with information on the number of students registered at the institution and on other courses funded either wholly or in part by NCTL
