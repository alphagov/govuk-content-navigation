      This note provides the latest information on planned hours to assist funded institutions plan study programmes across the individual academic years. (For funding purposes this means from 1 August to 31 July each year).
     </p>
     <p>
      The contractual requirements for planned hours are incorporated into the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance">

     <p>
      From August 2015 onwards, school census users need to enter data for one year only for each student. This is a change from 2014, where we asked you to enter 2 years data. Further information is available in section

      It is important to record

       non-qualification hours

      accurately. Some institutions are making errors in recording non-qualification hours. These errors can impact on your allocation so it is important to get it right.

     <h2 id="study-programmes">
      Study programmes
     </h2>
     <p>
      All 16 to 19 year old students are funded for an individual study programme. Most study programmes have a core aim. The core aim of a study programme should be a substantial academic or vocational qualification or work experience.
     </p>
     <p>
      The study programme must be tailored to each student, have clear study and/or employment goals reflecting the student’s prior attainment, and include
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       substantial qualifications or work experience
      </li>
      <li>
       maths and English for students who have not achieved  grade A*-C GCSE in these subjects
      </li>
      <li>
       high quality work experience or work preparation
      </li>
      <li>
       added value non-qualification activity that supports the students’ goals and is integrated into the study programme
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="planned-hours-and-funding-allocations">
      Planned hours and funding allocations
     </h2>
     <p>
      Planned hours are a fundamental element in the funding allocation process which uses data recorded in the Individualised Learner Record (ILR) and the school census. They are used to determine the proportion of students in each funding band which, in turn, determines the national funding rate per student. Errors in recording planned hours are likely to have an impact on an institution’s allocated funding. Accurate recording of planned hours is essential to ensure an institution’s funding allocation is calculated correctly.
     </p>
     <h2 id="planned-hours-EFA">
      Planned hours funded by the EFA
     </h2>
     <p>
      The activities in each student’s study programme in an academic year constitute the planned hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each student’s planned hours are agreed between the institution and the student at the start of their study programme. You must record accurately all the qualification planned hours and the non-qualification planned hours. This data is used to calculate future funding allocations so it must accurately record what learning activities are being undertaken by each student.
     </p>
     <p>
      To count for funding purposes, the planned hours must be timetabled, organised and/or supervised by the institution, and take place in line with the institution’s normal working pattern. For example they can include
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       planned tutor led activity on courses leading to qualifications
      </li>
      <li>
       planned hours of tutorials, work experience or work preparation
      </li>
      <li>
       planned hours on other activities relevant to the student’s study programme that are organised and provided by the institution, such as sport or volunteering
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Planned hours in a study programme are categorised as either qualification (planned learning hours) or non-qualification (planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours). All the hours in both categories need to be recorded accurately on the ILR or school census to avoid problems with future allocations. Both categories are added up to form the total hours of a study programme, and the total hours are used to calculate the funding allocation.
     </p>
     <h3 id="qualification-hours">
      Qualification hours
     </h3>
     <p>
      These are hours of teaching and learning that count towards qualifications that are approved for teaching to 16 to 19 year olds under section 96 (qualifications that are not approved under section 96 cannot be taught in schools).
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 96 qualifications are identified on the
      <a href="https://hub.fasst.org.uk/Learning%20Aims/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">
       Learning Aim Reference Service
      </a>
      (LARS).
     </p>
     <h3 id="qualification-hours">
      Non-qualification hours (employability, enrichment and pastoral hours)
     </h3>
     <p>
      These are hours of fundable activity that are not qualification based. These hours are also known as planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours (EEP hours).
     </p>
     <p>
      There are many activities that are defined as EEP and all need to be recorded in your data returns in order to be funded. If you don’t record all the EEP activities on your data returns then your allocation could be less than it should be.
     </p>
     <p id="includes-hours">
      This includes hours where students are doing activities that
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       do not count towards a qualification as defined above
      </li>
      <li>

      Intensive study programmes

     <p>
      In some exceptional circumstances a study programme can be delivered intensively, for example, long days over a few months. These compressed programmes enable students to complete a significant number of planned hours in a short period of time and should be linked to the need of the student to learn in this intensive way.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compressed study programmes are funded at the standard funding rates based on planned hours. The EFA expects compressed study programmes to lead to excellent results, as demonstrated through qualification success rates and positive destinations. The EFA monitors the delivery and value for money of compressed programmes to determine whether or not to take a different approach to such provision in future.

       funding band
      </a>
      for these students is determined by the number of planned hours assigned to them in each academic year.

     <h3 id="planned-hours-and-retakes">

     <p>
      Planned hours cannot normally be recorded for learning programmes designed to enable students to re-sit or retake examinations and assessments. These are not generally eligible for funding. This is because the institution has already been funded for the study programme including taking exams.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where there are exceptional circumstances outside the control of the student or institution, such as a period of long term sickness, or good educational reasons, then the retake delivery hours for individual students may be included in the funded study programme hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a student fails to complete a learning aim in the expected time span and stays on for additional time, including revision sessions or re-sits, no further funding is due. No study hours should be included on the ILR or school census for students repeating learning or retaking examinations.

     <p>
      Planned hours are entered onto the ILR for FE and on the school census for schools and academies.  All fundable qualification and non-qualification activity for the academic year must be recorded individually for each student.
     </p>
     <p>
      Data returns must reflect, as accurately as possible, the hours that are planned for the student at the start of their study programme. These will be the hours clearly recorded on each student’s timetable or learning agreement. Planned hours should be recorded for each student even where a group of students are studying similar qualifications. For example, a group may all be studying the same qualification but it is unlikely that other aspects of their study programme will be the same: English, maths, hours for tutorials, or for work experience may all be different. In this instance a blanket number of planned hours should not be recorded for a whole group of students, each must have their own planned hours recorded individually. Following this principle will reduce problems with data and with funding allocations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions must make sure that the planned hours are realistic and deliverable for each student. They must have evidence of this for audit purposes and have systems in place that enable an easy reconciliation between student timetables and the planned hours recorded on the ILR/school census. The audit process will be quicker and simpler when it is easy to see how the evidence relates to the recorded planned hours.

From autumn 2015 there is only one set of planned hours fields in the  autumn census. These are to record planned hours for students in the current academic year. This is a change from the autumn 2014 census where institutions recorded 2 academic years’ planned hours (one set for the end of 2013 to 2014 and one set for the start of 2014 to 2015).

     <p>
      Institutions should not normally change planned hours during the year once the funding qualifying period has passed.
     </p>
     <p>
      One exception is when students do more than one programme in a year. This applies to those who have completed all the activities on their first learning agreement or plan. The student may then start a second study programme and the institution must
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       record a new core aim
      </li>
      <li>
       change the planned hours to reflect the additional delivery of hours for the new study programme
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Another exception is where errors have occurred. These can be corrected.
     </p>
     <p>
      As the school census is completed only once per academic year in October, planned hours cannot be changed by schools and academies after that date.

     <p>
      When a student withdraws from a learning aim, and the funding qualifying period (usually 6 weeks for full time students) for the programme has passed, there is no need for the institution to change the planned hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a student withdraws from a learning aim and the funding qualifying period for the programme has not passed, the planned hours should be changed if the ILR is no longer accurate. If the student does not start another qualification in place of the one withdrawn, then the hours must not be included in the planned hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a student withdraws from all their learning aims and leaves the institution altogether, there is no need to change the planned hours. If the student leaves before completing the qualifying period for their programme, they will not count as a start for funding purposes. If they leave after completing the qualifying period, they will not count as retained and the institution’s retention factor will be negatively affected. For a student in school on an academic programme, as long as they are still in school for one of their aims then retention is not affected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Students who withdraw from part of their study programme should make up the time with other meaningful activity, either qualification or non-qualification hours.

      Audit and planned hours
     </h2>
     <p>
      As post-16 education is funded on planned hours, funding auditors will need to see an easy reconciliation between planned study hours on the ILR/school census and the hours on the student’s timetable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funding audit will continue to be focussed on the eligibility of the activity in study programmes ie that planned hours are relevant, planned, supervised, quality assured and organised/timetabled within the  normal working pattern of the institution and, for example, do not systematically include lunch breaks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funding auditors will satisfy themselves that planned hours are credible, deliverable and realistic. Institutions will need to be able to demonstrate that a robust system is in place for planning student programmes which are timetabled, roomed (where relevant), have resources in place and align with staff timetables. There should be evidence that the significant majority of the students are attending the majority of their planned programme.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is inevitable that some planned activities will not run and that some student’s individual plans will change in year, but we would not expect this to be the case for most students. Institutions should be monitoring, managing and reporting on student compliance with their study programmes and evidence of this should be made available to auditors as part of their programme of work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funding auditors will review individual student records and report where records indicate the institution’s systems are failing to monitor the delivery of study programmes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funding auditors will require changes to planned hours only where activity not eligible for funding is identified or systemic issues with determining and recording planned hours are identified. This may affect an institution’s funding. Auditors will be reporting to governing bodies any concerns that they uncover in the way the planned hours are being monitored and managed, and this should feed into a tightening up and improvement of the approach the institution takes for the following year as part of a clear action plan approved by the institutions’ audit committee.
