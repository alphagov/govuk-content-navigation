      We invite secondary schools and sixth-form colleges from across the north-east region to nominate pupils from year 11 or 12 for the prize.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prize recognises pupils achieving academic excellence as well as dedicating themselves to the service of others in their school and the wider community.

     <p>
      Nominations for the 2016 prize are now open and the closing date for entries is Friday 21 October 2016. We will announce the winner and the 9 runners-up in December 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every year, headteachers and principals can nominate any year 11 and 12 pupils who have shown:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       academic performance - with an emphasis on comparative excellence
      </li>
      <li>
       civic contribution - particularly volunteering personal time and resource; for example, by mentoring younger pupils, helping with extracurricular events, or working with a youth group or a charity outside of school hours
      </li>
      <li>
       interest in government, education, history or public service
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>

      As well as celebrating their achievement, the prize gives the winner the opportunity to pursue their interest in public service and education.
     </p>
     <p>
      We will invite the winner of the 2016 prize to a 2-day work experience placement at the Department for Education’s London office. We will pay all travel and accommodation costs for the winner and an accompanying adult.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary of State for Education will present the prize at Imperial College London in February 2017. The winner and 9 runners-up will tour the university campus.
