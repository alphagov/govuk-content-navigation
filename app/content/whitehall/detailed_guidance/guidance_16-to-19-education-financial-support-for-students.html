     </h2>
     <p>
      This advice provides information for institutions about the financial support young people may be able to access to help them participate in education and training. It covers a number of schemes, often described as student support schemes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund: pays a bursary of up to £1,200 a year to support young people in one of the defined vulnerable groups to participate in education. It also enables institutions to make discretionary awards to those young people they assess as facing the greatest financial barriers to participation.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        free meals in further education: provides meals for eligible young people (they or their parents receive one of the qualifying benefits).
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Care to Learn: support with the costs of childcare to ensure that young people who are parents are not prevented from participating in education because of these costs.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Residential Bursary Fund: allocations given to specialist institutions to help them contribute to the costs of accommodation for students they assess as facing financial barriers to accessing their specialist provision.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Residential Support Scheme: income-assessed support to help with the costs of accommodation for students who need to move away from home to participate because the substantial Level 2 or Level 3 qualification within their study programme is not available locally to their home address.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Dance and Drama Awards: scholarships offering income-assessed support for tuition fees and living costs at a small number of private dance and drama colleges in England. This award ensures that income is not a barrier to the most talented young people accessing this specialist provision.
       </p>

     </ul>

      16 to 19 Bursary Fund
     </h2>
     <p>
      The 16 to 19 Bursary Fund supports the most financially disadvantaged 16 to 19 year olds and those young people who most need help with the costs of staying in education.

     <p>
      There are 2 types of 16 to 19 bursaries:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a vulnerable bursary of up to £1,200 a year for young people in one of the defined vulnerable groups
      </li>
      <li>
       discretionary bursaries that institutions award to meet individual needs, for example, transport, meals, books and equipment
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="vulnerable-bursary">
      Vulnerable bursary
     </h3>
     <p>
      Students in one or more of the groups below can apply for a vulnerable bursary of up to £1,200. Institutions do not receive an allocation of funds for vulnerable bursaries. They need to draw down the funds by completing a funding claim form and submitting it to the Student Support Bursary Service via the

     <h3 id="discretionary-bursary">
      Discretionary bursary
     </h3>
     <p>
      Discretionary bursaries are awards made by institutions to individual students. They are targeted on overcoming the individual barriers to participation a student faces.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is up to institutions to decide which students will receive a discretionary bursary and how much they will receive. However, they should be targeted at students who cannot stay in education without financial help for things like transport, meals, books and equipment. Institutions should not make blanket or flat rate payments to all students.

       EFA
      </abbr>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Free meals are targeted at disadvantaged students. For the purposes of eligibility for free meals, disadvantage is defined by the students being in receipt of, or having parents who are in receipt of, one or more of the qualifying benefits. A student is only eligible to receive a free meal when they, or a parent/guardian on their behalf, have made a successful application to the institution where they are enrolled.
     </p>
     <p>
      Students must be aged between 16 and 18 on 31 August 2016 to be eligible for a free meal in the 2016 to 2017 academic year. Students who turn 19 during their study programme will remain eligible for a free meal until the end of the academic year in which they turn 19 or to the end of their study programme, whichever is sooner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions are required to provide a free meals to eligible students for each day that the student attends their study programme, where this is appropriate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions are expected to provide a meal free of charge to eligible students, or to fund the free meal via an electronic credit or voucher which can be redeemed on-site or off-site where institutions have made arrangements with nearby food outlets.

     <p>
      In the 2016 to 2017 academic year institutions will receive an allocation of funding for free meals based on their 2015 to 2016 ILR RO6 data returns and their lagged student number, ie the number of students they have assessed as eligible for, and in receipt of, free meals in the 2015 to 2016 academic year at RO6 combined with the number of students funded in the 2016 to 2017 academic year to provide an all year number.

      More information about the detail of the allocations methodology was sent to institutions with their allocations statements in March 2016.

     <p>
      Care to Learn helps young parents under the age of 20 to continue in, and return to education after the birth of a child by providing funding for childcare whilst the young parent is studying. The scheme can provide up to a maximum total amount of support of £160 per child per week or up to a maximum of £175 per child per week in London.
     </p>
     <p>
      The young parent’s study programme must have some public funding.

      Care to Learn will only fund childcare provision that is registered with Ofsted.

      Young parents must complete and submit a new application for each academic year they want to claim Care to Learn funding, even if their study programme runs for more than one year.

      provides financial help towards the costs of accommodation for students attending one of the institutions delivering specialist provision.
