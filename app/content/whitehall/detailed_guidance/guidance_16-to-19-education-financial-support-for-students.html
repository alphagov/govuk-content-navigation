      Discretionary bursary

     <p>
      Discretionary bursaries are awards made by institutions to individual students. They are designed to  overcome the individual barriers to participation a student faces.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions decide which students get  a discretionary bursary and how much they will get. But, they should target students who cannot stay in education without financial help for things such as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       transport
      </li>
      <li>
       meals
      </li>
      <li>
       books
      </li>
      <li>
       equipment
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Institutions should assess the help each student needs on an individual basis and not make blanket or flat rate payments to all students.

      C2L helps young parents under the age of 20 to continue in, and return to education after the birth of a child. It does this by providing funding for childcare whilst the young parent is studying. The scheme can provide up to a maximum total amount of support of £160 per child per week or up to a maximum of £175 per child per week in London.
     </p>
     <p>
      The young parent’s study programme must have some public funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      C2L will only fund childcare provision registered with Ofsted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Young parents, their education institution and their childcare provider must all meet the eligibility criteria to receive C2L.
     </p>
     <p>
      Young parents must complete and submit a new C2L application for each academic year. Childcare providers and education institutions also need to provide information for each young parent who applies.  Students submit applications online via the
