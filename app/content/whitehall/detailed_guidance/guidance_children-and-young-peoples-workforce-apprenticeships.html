      The exact nature of your job role will depend on your employer. The intermediate level apprenticeship is for those working under supervision such as a nursery assistant or playgroup assistant working with children under 5.
     </p>
     <p>
      The advanced level apprenticeship is for those who work on their own initiative: planning and organising their own work and/or supervising others eg a nursery nurse, playgroup leader or a childminder working in their own home.
