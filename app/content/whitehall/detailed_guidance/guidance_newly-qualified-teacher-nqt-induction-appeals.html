      Overview
     </h2>
     <p>
      After you have achieved Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) you need to complete a
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-newly-qualified-teachers-nqts">
       statutory induction period
      </a>
      to teach in a maintained school, a maintained nursery school or a non-maintained special school in England.
     </p>
     <p>
      The appropriate body decides whether you have met the induction standards. The appropriate body can be any of the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a local authority
      </li>
      <li>
       a teaching school
      </li>
      <li>
       the National Induction Panel for Teachers
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      For independent schools, including academies and free schools, the appropriate body can also be the Independent Schools Teacher Induction Panel.
     </p>
     <h2 id="appeals-process">
      Appeals process
     </h2>
     <p>
      You can appeal to the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL), which acts on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, if you:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       have failed your induction period
      </li>
      <li>
       think your induction period should be extended
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-appeals-procedures">
       induction appeals procedures document
      </a>
      outlines the induction appeal process.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once we have received an appeal, we will arrange for an induction appeal panel to hear it. Panel members are recruited through a public appointments process. A least 1 panel member will be a teacher or will have been a teacher in the previous 5 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      You have the right to take part in the induction appeal proceedings and to be represented. You can also request that the appeal is decided without a hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      In deciding an appeal, the panel will make a recommendation to the Secretary of State based on whether it is satisfied that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       you have failed to meet the
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/teachers-standards">
        Teachers’ Standards
       </a>
      </li>
      <li>
       any issues regarding your support during induction were of sufficient importance to have seriously disadvantaged you in meeting the standards
      </li>
      <li>
       it appears that you would be able to meet the standards if your induction period were extended
      </li>
      <li>
       there are any other special circumstances that justify the appeal being allowed or the induction period being extended
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Secretary of State has the following options when deciding your appeal:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       allow the appeal
      </li>
      <li>
       dismiss the appeal
      </li>
      <li>
       extend the induction for a period
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="attend-a-hearing-as-an-observer">
      Attend a hearing as an observer
     </h2>
     <p>
      Induction appeal hearings are held in public. Members of the press and the public can attend hearings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-misconduct-forthcoming-professional-conduct-hearings">
       Details of forthcoming induction appeal hearings
      </a>
      will be published 5 working days before they’re due to take place.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you’re interested in attending a hearing, please contact:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the teacher regulation team (for members of the public)
      </li>
      <li>
       the Department for Education’s central newsdesk (for journalists)
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We can’t guarantee your place as an observer otherwise.
     </p>
     <p>
      The panel may exclude the public and press from the hearing or part of the hearing where:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       it believes that a public hearing may adversely affect the fairness of the proceedings
      </li>
      <li>
       it is necessary to protect children’s interests
      </li>
      <li>
       either party requests that the hearing be in private and the panel is satisfied that this is not contrary to the public interest
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
