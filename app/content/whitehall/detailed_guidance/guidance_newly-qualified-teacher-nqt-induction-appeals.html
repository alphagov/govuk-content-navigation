       Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
       After you have achieved Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) you need to complete a
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-newly-qualified-teachers-nqts">
        statutory induction period
       </a>
       to teach in a maintained school, a maintained nursery school or a non-maintained special school in England.
      </p>
      <p>
       The appropriate body decides whether you have met the induction standards. The appropriate body can be any of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a local authority
       </li>
       <li>
        a teaching school
       </li>
       <li>
        the National Induction Panel for Teachers
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       For independent schools, including academies and free schools, the appropriate body can also be the Independent Schools Teacher Induction Panel.
      </p>
      <h2 id="appeals-process">
       Appeals process
      </h2>
      <p>
       You can appeal to the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL), which acts on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, if you:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        have failed your induction period
       </li>
       <li>
        think your induction period should be extended
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-appeals-procedures">
        induction appeals procedures document
       </a>
       outlines the induction appeal process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we have received an appeal, we will arrange for an induction appeal panel to hear it. Panel members are recruited through a public appointments process. A least 1 panel member will be a teacher or will have been a teacher in the previous 5 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the right to take part in the induction appeal proceedings and to be represented. You can also request that the appeal is decided without a hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In deciding an appeal, the panel will make a recommendation to the Secretary of State based on whether it is satisfied that:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        you have failed to meet the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/teachers-standards">
         Teachers’ Standards
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        any issues regarding your support during induction were of sufficient importance to have seriously disadvantaged you in meeting the standards
       </li>
       <li>
        it appears that you would be able to meet the standards if your induction period were extended
       </li>
       <li>
        there are any other special circumstances that justify the appeal being allowed or the induction period being extended
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The Secretary of State has the following options when deciding your appeal:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        allow the appeal
       </li>
       <li>
        dismiss the appeal
       </li>
       <li>
        extend the induction for a period
       </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="attend-a-hearing-as-an-observer">
       Attend a hearing as an observer
      </h2>
      <p>
       Induction appeal hearings are held in public. Members of the press and the public can attend hearings.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-misconduct-forthcoming-professional-conduct-hearings">
        Details of forthcoming induction appeal hearings
       </a>
       will be published 5 working days before they’re due to take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you’re interested in attending a hearing, please contact:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        the teacher regulation team (for members of the public)
       </li>
       <li>
        the Department for Education’s central newsdesk (for journalists)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       We can’t guarantee your place as an observer otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The panel may exclude the public and press from the hearing or part of the hearing where:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        it believes that a public hearing may adversely affect the fairness of the proceedings
       </li>
       <li>
        it is necessary to protect children’s interests
       </li>
       <li>
        either party requests that the hearing be in private and the panel is satisfied that this is not contrary to the public interest
       </li>
      </ul>
