      Express logistics is the delivery of goods and packages as quickly as possible to the recipient. The sector is one of the fastest growing industries in the UK.

      People no longer want to wait 7 to 10 working days for a parcel when they can get it the following day by paying a small extra fee. Because of the nature of the industry, much of the work is quite demanding, with services having to run like clockwork in order to arrange delivery by the designated time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite growing so quickly, there is a skill-gap in the sector, as many high-level managers and supervisors have been promoted from within companies in the express logistics industry.
