       Every school maintained by the local authority should have a whistleblowing procedure. Whistleblowing procedures protect staff members who report colleagues they believe are doing something wrong or illegal, or who are neglecting their duties.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/whistleblowing">
        Information for employees on ‘blowing the whistle’

       , including a definition of whistleblowing, is available.

      <h2 id="whistleblowing-procedure">
       Whistleblowing procedure
      </h2>
      <p>
       Governing bodies of maintained schools are responsible for agreeing and establishing the school’s whistleblowing procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should base your whistleblowing procedure on your local authority’s procedure. Ask your local authority for a copy of their whistleblowing arrangements and tailor them to fit your school’s circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should appoint at least one member of staff and at least one governor who other members of staff can contact if they wish to report concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your governing body minutes should include a record of:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        your school’s whistleblowing arrangements
       </li>
       <li>
        the people in and outside the school that staff members should report concerns to
       </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="informing-staff">
       Informing staff
      </h2>
      <p>
       You should inform every member of staff of your school’s whistleblowing arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should also tell school staff who they can contact in the local authority in case a staff member feels they should report to someone outside the school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every staff member, including temporary staff and contractors, should know:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        what protection is available to them if they decide to report another member of staff
       </li>
       <li>
        what areas of malpractice or wrongdoing are covered in your school’s whistleblowing procedure
       </li>
       <li>
        the different routes available to them for reporting a concern, including who they can approach both in the school and in the local authority
       </li>
