      Every school maintained by the local authority should have a whistleblowing procedure. Whistleblowing procedures protect staff members who report colleagues they believe are doing something wrong or illegal, or who are neglecting their duties.
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/whistleblowing">
       Information for employees on ‘blowing the whistle’
      </a>
      , including a definition of whistleblowing, is available.

     <h2 id="whistleblowing-procedure">
      Whistleblowing procedure
     </h2>
     <p>
      Governing bodies of maintained schools are responsible for agreeing and establishing the school’s whistleblowing procedure.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should base your whistleblowing procedure on your local authority’s procedure. Ask your local authority for a copy of their whistleblowing arrangements and tailor them to fit your school’s circumstances.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should appoint at least one member of staff and at least one governor who other members of staff can contact if they wish to report concerns.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your governing body minutes should include a record of:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       your school’s whistleblowing arrangements
      </li>
      <li>
       the people in and outside the school that staff members should report concerns to
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="informing-staff">
      Informing staff
     </h2>
     <p>
      You should inform every member of staff of your school’s whistleblowing arrangements.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should also tell school staff who they can contact in the local authority in case a staff member feels they should report to someone outside the school.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every staff member, including temporary staff and contractors, should know:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       what protection is available to them if they decide to report another member of staff
      </li>
      <li>
       what areas of malpractice or wrongdoing are covered in your school’s whistleblowing procedure
      </li>
      <li>
       the different routes available to them for reporting a concern, including who they can approach both in the school and in the local authority
      </li>
     </ul>
