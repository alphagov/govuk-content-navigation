      Local authorities can decide to place a child with an adoptive family that was assessed and approved by a different adoption agency (this can be another local authority or a voluntary adoption agency (
      <abbr title="voluntary adoption agency">
       VAA
      </abbr>
      )). In these cases, the agency will charge a fee to cover the costs of recruiting, assessing and approving the adopters. This is called the inter-agency fee.
     </p>
     <p>
      <abbr title="voluntary adoption agencies">
       VAAs
      </abbr>
      are organisations that recruit, approve and support people interested in adopting a child. Unlike local authorities, they don’t have children in their care.
     </p>
     <p>
      The inter-agency adoption fee grant is a government grant that reimburses the money local authorities spend on inter-agency fees for ‘hard-to-place’ children.
     </p>
     <p>
      We originally set up a £30-million fund for placements made between 8 July 2015 and 31 October 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      We’ve now extended the fund: local authorities can get the grant for placements made between 1 November 2016 and 31 March 2017 if they meet certain criteria.

     <p>
      The deadline for submitting a claim for a child you placed during this period is Wednesday, 30 November 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can claim the grant for placements that met at least one of the following criteria:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       children who had waited 18 months or longer to be placed with a family
      </li>
      <li>
       children who were aged 5 years or older at the time they were placed with a family
      </li>
      <li>
       children who were in a sibling group of 2 or more children, and were placed with a family as siblings
      </li>
      <li>
       black or minority ethnic children (use the definition for ‘black or minority ethnic children’ that you use when you submit data to the Adoption Leadership Board every quarter)
      </li>
      <li>
       disabled children (use the definition of ‘disabled children’ that you use when you submit data to the Adoption Leadership Board every quarter)
      </li>
     </ul>

      Placements made between 1 November 2016 and 31 March 2017
     </h3>
     <p>
      You should submit your claim in the first 10 working days of the month following the month of the placement. For example, the deadline for submitting a claim for a placement made in November 2016 would be 14 December 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can claim  the grant for placements that meet at least one of the following criteria:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       children who, at 1 November 2016, have waited 18 months or longer to be placed with a family (this means 18 months or longer from the point of entering care)
      </li>
      <li>
       children who are in a sibling group placed in a family, where at least one child has waited 18 months or longer for their placement at 1 November 2016
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Placements where the child reaches the 18-month threshold after 1 November 2016 are not eligible for the grant.

      You’ll get the following amount of funding when you submit a valid claim:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       £27,000 for placing 1 child
      </li>
      <li>
       £43,000 for placing 2 siblings in 1 adoptive family
      </li>
      <li>
       £60,000 for placing 3 siblings in 1 adoptive family
      </li>
      <li>
       £68,000 for placing 4 siblings in 1 adoptive family
      </li>
      <li>
       £80,000 for placing 5 or more siblings in 1 adoptive family
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      These amounts match the national inter-agency fee.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you make an inter-agency placement through a scheme or agency that charges more than the national rate, you’ll have to cover the extra costs.

     <h2 id="how-to-spend-the-grant">

      The grant provides agencies with an opportunity to search nationally for available adopters for hard-to-place children who’ve been waiting the longest.
     </p>
     <p>
      It also offers an opportunity to use the funding for adoption support. Agencies may want to use the grant in conjunction with the
      <a href="http://www.adoptionsupportfund.co.uk" rel="external">
       Adoption Support Fund
      </a>
      to make placements and offer support packages at the point of placement.
