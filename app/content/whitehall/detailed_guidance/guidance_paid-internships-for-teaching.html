      Overview
     </h2>
     <p>
      Grants are available for school-led partnerships to design and provide paid internships for undergraduate students in their penultimate year at university. The aim is to increase the number of mathematics and physics teachers.
     </p>
     <p>
      A pilot paid internship scheme took place in summer 2016. Schools were invited to apply for funding in a second cohort to provide opportunities in summer 2017 for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (
      <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">
       STEM
      </abbr>
      ) undergraduates to experience mathematics or physics teaching before they commit to it as a career.
     </p>
     <h2 id="apply">
      Apply
     </h2>
     <p>
      The application round is now closed.
     </p>
     <h2 id="who-can-apply">
      Who can apply
     </h2>
     <p>
      Applications are invited from school-led partnerships, for example a School Direct (SD) partnership or an accredited school-centred Initial teacher training provider (SCITT).
     </p>
     <p>
      If you are a small partnership and do not have the capacity to attract 10
      <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">
       STEM
      </abbr>
      undergraduates to the programme, we suggest you contact other lead schools or partnerships in your area to see if they would be interested in being part of the partnership to submit a joint application.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since schools will be the ultimate employers of the participants should they go on to teaching, accredited
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      providers can’t submit applications. However, school partnerships may collaborate with an accredited
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      provider to develop and deliver the programmes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your partnership lead should submit the application as they will have overall responsibility for the budget. However, they should work in collaboration with the partner schools and
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      provider to develop the proposals.
     </p>
     <h2 id="whats-involved">
      What’s involved
     </h2>
     <p>
      If your school-led partnership is successful in your application, you’ll be expected to attend an introductory event with the National College for Teaching and Leadership (
      <abbr title="National College for Teaching and Leadership">
       NCTL
      </abbr>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      Your partnership should:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       aim to recruit at least 10 undergraduates to your programme
      </li>
      <li>
       lead on delivery and placing interns in schools
      </li>
      <li>
       develop and use links with local universities to enable you to access and recruit participants
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The number of places you request for the programme should reflect a realistic assessment of your training capacity and recruitment audience. You should base your programme development on a minimum of 10 trainees in mathematics and physics combined, however if you assess that you can recruit more participants you should indicate this in your application.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is expected the programme will take place at the end of undergraduates’ penultimate year, and should last for 4 weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The programme should offer interns the chance to gain a deep experience of teaching, and may include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a combination of teaching, running science projects, offering intensive support for children who are struggling, and helping with experiments and laboratory work
      </li>
      <li>
       structured training, shadowing and lesson observation, followed by a chance to jointly plan and deliver lessons
      </li>
      <li>
       one-to-one mentors who are good or outstanding classroom teachers in their specialism
      </li>
      <li>
       opportunities to network with qualified subject specialists
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We expect the design of the programme to include measures to support and encourage interns to apply for teacher training. This might include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       continued contact with their mentor
      </li>
      <li>
       support for the intern to make an application through UCAS or Teach First if appropriate and undertake their skills tests
      </li>
      <li>
       guarantee of an interview for any
       <abbr title="initial teacher training">
        ITT
       </abbr>
       places that they apply for at that partnership
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      All interns should register with
      <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/user/register" rel="external">
       Get into Teaching
      </a>
      so they can receive additional support.
     </p>
     <p>
      You will be required to share the learning from the programme with other schools, universities, and initial teacher training (
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      ) providers.
     </p>
     <h2 id="funding">
      Funding
     </h2>
     <p>
      For the minimum cohort size of 10 interns the grant funding would equate to £20,000. The funding is for £500 per week, per student. Of this £500 per week:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       £300 will be used to cover the intern’s expenses
      </li>
      <li>
       £200 will go directly to the school to cover co-ordination costs and overheads
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Funding will be paid through a
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/grant-funding-agreement-terms-and-conditions">
       grant funding agreement
      </a>
      which will need to be agreed and signed by all successful bidders. The funding does not cover costs or expenses incurred in preparing your bid.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you’re sucessful in your application, you will commence the scheme in January 2017. The grant will be available until 31 August 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the Government’s commitment to efficiency controls, you should be aware that there are restrictions on all paid-for communications, marketing and digital activities. Any items that fall within the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-controls">
       Cabinet Office’s Efficiency Controls guidance
      </a>
      should be clearly outlined in the projected costs section of the request to deliver template. Although we do not expect this to be a significant portion of the grant, any spend in this area needs specific prior
      <abbr title="National College for Teaching and Leadership">
       NCTL
      </abbr>
      approval. The controls relating to communications and marketing activity include printing, publications, events and public relations (PR).
     </p>
     <p>
      Although paid-for marketing activities are restricted under grant funding guidelines, our support and marketing resources are freely available to all lead schools. These include the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/school-direct-marketing-resource-bank">
       marketing resource bank
      </a>
      (which offers new ready-made and adaptable marketing materials such as posters, parent letters, flyers and outdoor banners), participation at train to teach events, and online seminars offering recruitment advice and guidance.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should indicate in your application if any irrecoverable VAT is applicable, and if so, include VAT separately in all costings as the full £20,000 grant is inclusive of VAT. All successful applicants will be required to submit a ‘certificate of expenditure (which is outlined in annex G of the grant funding agreement) at the end of the grant cycle as assurance of expenditure.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payments will be staged and subject to assurance that programmes are developed and recruitment is progressing to support viable programmes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funding will not be provided for participants interested in teaching other subjects, however you may wish to indicate in your application if you intend to offer internship placements in other subjects in the additional information section.
     </p>
     <p>
      If your partnership is also in receipt of
      <abbr title="National College for Teaching and Leadership">
       NCTL
      </abbr>
      grant funding to develop other
      <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">
       STEM
      </abbr>
      programmes, we expect your application to consider where you can make efficiencies to achieve value for money.
     </p>
     <p>
      You must submit progress reports, on the template provided as part of your grant agreement, in order to process payments.

     <p>
      Despite sustained prioritisation of
      <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">
       STEM
      </abbr>
      recruitment through generous financial incentives over a number of years, there remains a challenge to recruit enough specialist teachers to these subjects, in particular mathematics and physics, to meet projected demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      To meet the UK’s growing demand for
      <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">
       STEM
      </abbr>
      skills, on 11 March 2015 the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-plans-to-attract-and-train-maths-and-physics-teachers">
       Prime Minister announced  a range of initiatives
      </a>
      to increase the number of high-quality teachers in
      <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">
       STEM
      </abbr>
      subjects. This included a paid internship for teaching scheme proposal. Feedback from the pilot was positive and we would like to run a second cohort to allow us to offer further internships and to allow us to build on the schemes success.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent research by
      <a href="http://www.highfliers.co.uk/" rel="external">
       High Fliers
      </a>
      shows that new graduates are looking for jobs earlier than ever before. In the January 2015 survey, a third of employers reported more graduate job applications in the earliest recruitment stages, whilst recruiters indicated that they expect 31% of this year’s entry-level positions to be filled by graduates who have already worked for their organisations – either through internships or work experience.
     </p>
     <p>
      We increasingly need to target undergraduates earlier in their university careers, in order to support overall
      <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">
       STEM
      </abbr>
      teacher recruitment and the development of paid internships responds to this. Additionally, the internships will offer the opportunity to target students who may not have traditionally considered teaching as a career of choice. Teaching internships offered to undergraduates in the penultimate year of their degree will provide an alternative offer to students.
     </p>
     <p>
      School-led partnerships are ideally placed to design and deliver a paid internship scheme as they can readily access placements and build relationships with participants that lead to them accepting an
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      place and future employment. Links with local universities are crucial to promote the internships.
     </p>
     <p>
      This funding is for a second paid internship cohort only and future funds are dependent on the success of the scheme, including viability and sustainability.
