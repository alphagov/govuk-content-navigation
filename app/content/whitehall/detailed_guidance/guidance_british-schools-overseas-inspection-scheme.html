      We have put in place a voluntary inspection scheme for overseas schools. This ensures schools provide their pupils with the skills and qualifications they need to enter or re-enter the British education system. The scheme helps to inform parents of how the standards in these schools measure up against the standards that apply to independent schools in England.

     </p>
     <p>
      To become accredited you must have an inspection every 3 years which shows that your performance against all the standards is at least satisfactory.

      Inspectorates are approved by us and monitored by Ofsted to inspect British schools overseas and produce inspection reports.

      Ofsted reports annually on the quality of the approved organisation’s inspections: ‘
