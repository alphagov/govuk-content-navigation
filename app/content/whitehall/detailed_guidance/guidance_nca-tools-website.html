      To make sure you receive emails from the NCA tools website, please ensure your ICT department accepts all email addresses ending in ‘education.gov.uk’. If your system cannot be amended in this way, add assessments@education.gov.uk to your organisation’s safe senders email list. This will allow emails to be sent straight through to recipients and not blocked by spam filters.
