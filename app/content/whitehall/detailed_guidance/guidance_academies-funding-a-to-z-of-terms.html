      The grant is paid in support of local authorities’ schools budget. It is the main source of income for the schools budget. Local authorities are responsible for determining the split of the grant between central expenditure and the individual schools budget (

      The schools forum is a body comprising representatives of maintained schools, academies, and early years providers within a local authority area, together with other local partners and stakeholders. The role of the schools forum is to advise the council on matters affecting schools funding – principally the allocation of dedicated schools grant (

      ), and the local funding formulae which distribute budgets to schools, early years providers and other maintained education settings. It has some decision making powers, mainly in relation to central schools block expenditure. More information is available in

     <p>
      An optional funding factor in local authorities’ mainstream pre-16 schools block funding formula. Schools that are eligible for sparsity funding must meet two criteria: first, they are located in areas where pupils would have to travel a significant distance to an alternative should the school close, and second, they are small schools.

      Split site
     </h3>
     <p>
      An optional funding factor in local authorities’ mainstream pre-16 schools block funding formula. The purpose of this factor is to support schools which have unavoidable extra costs because the school buildings are on separate sites. Allocations must be based on objective criteria, both for the definition of a split site and for how much is paid. More information is available in

     <p>
      Start-up grant is paid to sponsored academies. From September 2013 this was limited to full sponsored academies only.  There are two elements, part A and part B. Part A is a flat rate allocation that is paid in the first year of opening. Part B is a formulaic allocation that is intended to contribute to costs, such as leadership, as a new academy grows towards full capacity. Consequently, part B may be paid over a number of years as the academy grows.
