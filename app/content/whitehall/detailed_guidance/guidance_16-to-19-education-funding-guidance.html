      Colleges, providers, schools and academies receive annual funding allocations from Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      ) for the provision of 16 to 19 education.
     </p>

      Information about the procedures involved in allocating funding can be found on the

       An overview of 16 to 19 funding
      </a>
      is available on GOV.UK. This includes how funding is calculated using the
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      funding formula that incorporates factors including student numbers, student retention, higher cost subjects, disadvantaged students and area costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is supplemented by additional funding for high needs students, bursaries and other financial support awarded to individual students and, currently, transitional protection and formula protection funding (
      <abbr title="formula protection funding">
       FPF
      </abbr>
      ) to take into account changes from previous funding arrangements.

      Below, you can find a set of guidance documents for each year that all post-16 education institutions receiving
