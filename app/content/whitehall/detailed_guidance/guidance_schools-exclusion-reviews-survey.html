      The school exclusion reviews survey is an annual, statutory data collection that all local authorities must complete by the beginning of March. You must complete statutory data collections by law unless there’s a good reason not to.
     </p>
     <p>
      The survey records the number and outcomes of all exclusion reviews that parents or guardians lodge (ask for) and that an independent review panel determines (decides) during the academic year.
     </p>
     <p>
      It applies to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       schools and alternative provision (
       <abbr title="alternative provision">
