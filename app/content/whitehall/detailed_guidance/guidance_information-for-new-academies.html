      Transferring the balance of your predecessor school’s funds
     </h2>
     <p>
      For academies without a sponsor your local authority must finalise your closing balance within 4 months of your conversion date. You are asked to work with your local authority to facilitate this.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the agreed closing balance is a surplus, your local authority must pay within 1 month of finalising the amount. If the agreed closing balance is a deficit,
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      will settle that amount with your local authority and set up a repayment plan with you. For small amounts, you can repay the deficit directly to your local authority, as long as you inform us in advance.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you’re unable to agree the amount owed, you can ask us to review it, but must do so within 1 month of your local authority making their decision on the final closing balance.
     </p>
     <p>
      For sponsored academies, any deficit remains with the local authority and doesn’t have to be repaid by your academy trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      The way surpluses are dealt with depends on how you were granted an academy order. In most cases, an academy order was issued because the school’s governing body applied for one and the surplus transfers to the academy trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an academy order is issued without an application from the governing body, any surplus remains with the local authority. In practice, some local authorities have chosen to transfer the surplus.
     </p>
     <p>
      For converter projects, if your local authority determines there is a deficit balance at the date of conversion,
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      will write to you to agree that amount and, subject to agreement, will reimburse that sum to your local authority and recover it from your
      <abbr title="general annual grant">
       GAG
      </abbr>
      .
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      will work with you to agree a timetable for doing so. Any surpluses should be paid across by your local authority with no involvement from the department.
     </p>
     <p>
      Academies are not allowed to run a deficit without remedial action. Any that open with a transferred deficit will need to agree at the earliest opportunity with
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      , a plan to repay it from
      <abbr title="general annual grant">
       GAG
      </abbr>
      installments. Academies that develop a deficit after opening will have to agree a restructuring plan with

      Revenue funding: start-up grant
     </h2>
     <p>
      Schools get a start-up grant of £25,000 to help with the costs of converting, such as legal fees, stationery and signage. The grant is paid into your school’s new bank account when the Secretary of State has made an academy order agreeing to the conversion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your school can keep any unspent balance from this flat rate grant and add it to overall income.
     </p>
     <p>
      Start-up funding information is also available for
