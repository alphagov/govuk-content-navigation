     <h3 id="academy-trust">
      Academy trust
     </h3>
     <p>
      When you have received your academy order, you will need to set up your academy trust. An academy trust is a charitable company limited by guarantee, made up of members and directors. The directors will also be the governors of the
      <abbr title="alternative provision">
       AP
      </abbr>
      academy. They will be responsible for its day-to-day management and governance (replacing the
      <abbr title="pupil referral unit">
       PRU
      </abbr>
      ’s management committee).
     </p>
     <p>
      The members of the trust will be its legal owners and have overall control over the company and the way the academy is run. Normally there should be 3 founding members of the academy trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before setting up the trust, you (or your solicitor) will need to fill in the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-model-memorandum-and-articles-of-association">
       model memorandum and articles of association
      </a>

       PRUs
      </abbr>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The memorandum sets out the name of the trust and its founding members. The articles of association set out the arrangements for the management, governance and running of the academy trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should send these to your project lead and, once they’ve been approved, you can register your trust with
      <a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/" rel="external">
       Companies House
      </a>
      and set up a new bank account. There is a fee for this, but you will get the money back from your conversion grant.
     </p>
     <h3 id="land-and-buildings">
      Land and buildings
     </h3>
     <p>
      Your solicitor will help you complete the

       <abbr title="pupil referral unit">
        PRU
       </abbr>
       -specific land questionnaire
      </a>
      , and will submit it to your project lead for approval. If you are a multi-site
      <abbr title="pupil referral unit">
       PRU
      </abbr>
      , you will need to complete a questionnaire for each site.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your academy trust, local authority, and any other parties should agree the leasing arrangements for
      <abbr title="pupil referral unit">
       PRU
      </abbr>
      land and buildings. These must be in place before you sign your funding agreement. If the land transfer involves a sub-lease, you will need to submit it to your project lead for approval.
     </p>
     <h3 id="funding-agreement">
      Funding agreement
     </h3>
     <p>
      The funding agreement is the contract between the Secretary of State and your academy trust and is the method by which we hold all academies accountable. It sets out terms for funding, how the academy is run, its duties and the powers the Secretary of State has over your academy. The funding agreement makes references to legislation to ensure that academies operate in a similar way to other state-funded schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      You (or your solicitor) should submit your draft funding agreement to your project lead at the same time as you submit your draft memorandum and articles of association, and land questionnaire.

      The academy trust needs to take over as the employer, so the local authority will need to start the formal Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (

       TUPE
      </abbr>
      ) process. This process ensures that all information on the staff who are transferring to the academy is recorded and transferred to the trust.

     <p>
      When you are an
      <abbr title="alternative provision">
       AP
      </abbr>
      academy, your trust will be responsible for staff pensions, even if your local authority continues to act as payroll provider. The occupational pension schemes are the local government pension scheme (
      <abbr title="local government pension scheme">
       LGPS
      </abbr>
      ) for non-teaching staff and the teachers’ pensions scheme (
      <abbr title="teachers' pensions scheme">
       TPS

      ) for teaching staff.

     <p>
      The
      <abbr title="teachers' pensions scheme">

     </p>
     <p>
      Your funding agreement requires you to offer
      <abbr title="local government pension scheme">
       LGPS
      </abbr>
      membership to all non-teaching staff. Existing staff who are already members of the
      <abbr title="local government pension scheme">
       LGPS
      </abbr>
      will be unaffected and their membership will continue. After conversion, any new non-teaching staff will be eligible to join.

      The
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/academies-risk-protection-arrangement-rpa">
       risk protection arrangement
      </a>
      (RPA) for academy trusts is an alternative to insurance where losses that arise are covered by government funds. The scheme will come into effect from 1 September 2014. Academies can opt into the scheme, at no additional cost or premium, before they convert or before their current insurance arrangements come to an end. As losses are covered by public funds, RPA is more secure than commercial insurance.
     </p>
     <p>
      As well as significant cost savings for school budgets, academies which opt to the RPA will avoid complex and time-consuming procurement of commercial insurance cover. Opting in to the scheme and updating cover is simple and quick. You must ensure you are adequately covered from midnight of the date of conversion.
     </p>
     <p>
      The RPA will reimburse academies in the event of a loss outlined in the ‘Academies risk protection arrangement scope’[InlineAttachment:!@1] document. It will not cover risks related to motor, overseas travel, statutory engineering inspections and works of art.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department for Education will provide a route to the commercial insurance market to purchase additional cover to manage these risks.

The greater independence that academies have means that as well as the day-to-day processing of income and expenditure, you will have to produce management accounts, cash flow reconciliations and balance sheets.

      Advance of payment
     </h3>
     <p>
      Up to March 2015, EFA can give you an advance in your first year that is equal to your projected local authority top-up funding. Your project lead will be able to advise you. You will need to pay this money back to EFA by March 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you’d like an advance, you will need to provide a short business case based on the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/academies-apply-for-advances-of-funding">
       EFA guidance on advance funding

      Business manager grant

     <p>
      You can apply for a grant to fund a business manager up to March 2015. The amount of grant will be based on the size of the former
      <abbr title="pupil referral unit">
       PRU
      </abbr>
      , and addresses the fact that many
      <abbr title="pupil referral units">
       PRUs
      </abbr>
      will now have to pay for finance staff to do work that was previously carried out by the local authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also, smaller
      <abbr title="pupil referral units">
       PRUs
      </abbr>
      and those that cater only for permanent exclusions might not have had time to build relationships with schools that want places in the
      <abbr title="pupil referral unit">
       PRU
      </abbr>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      To address these issues, a tapered grant, based on the size of the
      <abbr title="pupil referral unit">

      , is available to
      <abbr title="alternative provision">

      academies to fund a business manager for the period up until March 2015.
