      In the 2016 to 2017 financial year, schools will receive the following funding for each child registered as eligible for free school meals at any point in the last 6 years:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       £1,320 for pupils in reception year to year 6
      </li>
      <li>
       £935 for pupils in year 7 to year 11
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Schools will also receive £1,900 for each pupil identified in the spring

      Children who have been in local-authority care for 1 day or more also attract £1,900 of pupil premium funding. Funding for these pupils is managed by the
