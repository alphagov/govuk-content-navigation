      How to apply
     </h2>
     <p>
      You must have a UK Provider Registration Number (UKPRN).
     </p>
     <p>
      You can register with the
      <a href="http://www.ukrlp.co.uk/" rel="external">
       UK Register of Learning Providers
      </a>
      (UKRLP) to get one. This number is not specific to learning providers and any organisation associated with learning can get one.
     </p>
     <p>
      You then need to register on our
      <a href="https://skillsfundingagency.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.shtml" rel="external">
       e-tendering portal
      </a>
      in order to complete our market entry pre-qualification process.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pre-qualification process includes completing due diligence questions and capacity and capability questions, which are available to complete 3 times each year:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        the due diligence questions collect important details about your organisation, test compliance with the Public Contract Regulations 2015 and financially assess your organisation to determine if you are
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-financial-health-assessment">
         financially robust
        </a>
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        the capacity and capability questions help you understand what is required to have a contract with the SFA; this includes specific questions that relate to the areas you are interested in tendering for
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If you want to be eligible to tender, you must complete the due diligence questions and capacity and capability questions, which can be completed at the same time. The SFA will not accept any late submissions, alterations or additional information after we have closed for applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      We recommend you read our ‘

      How your application is assessed

     <p>
      Organisations that pass the due diligence questions will be listed on the register of training organisations. If you also pass the capacity and capability questions, you will be invited to tender when opportunities become available.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you fail the due diligence questions, you will not be listed on the register and we will not evaluate your capacity and capability questions.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you pass the due diligence questions, but fail the capacity and capability questions you will be listed on the register, but you will not be invited to tender.
