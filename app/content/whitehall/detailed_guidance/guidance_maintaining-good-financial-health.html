     </p>
     <p>
      In this video, Zoe Carr (CEO) and Fiona Hardie (CFO) demonstrate how WISE Academies has ensured good financial health. They demonstrate the journey they have been on, including some of the key actions that they’ve taken and how they’ve set about improving the finance function of WISE Academies.
     </p>
     <p>
      They explain the processes they have put in place to improve their finance functions and the benefits this has brought.  They describe how the Trust manages all other aspects of central financial control for the schools and for the Trust. They present a case study outlining one example of how they have responded to falling rolls in one of their academies.
