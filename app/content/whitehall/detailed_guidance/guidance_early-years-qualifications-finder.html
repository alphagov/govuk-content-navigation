      All providers working with children from birth to 5 years old must follow the regulations on qualified staff to child ratios. These regulations are set out in the

       statutory framework for the early years foundation stage (

        EYFS

      The National College for Teaching and Leadership (

     </p>
     <p>
      Our Early Years Qualifications List is a searchable list of qualifications. Both providers and those wanting to work in an early years setting can use it to check qualifications and confirm if a person can be counted in the qualified staff to child ratios.

       Early years educator qualifications

      were introduced in September 2014. They are qualifications at level 3 or above, approved by
      <abbr title="National College for Teaching and Leadership">
       NCTL
      </abbr>
      as meeting the early years educator criteria.
     </p>
     <p>
      If staff have an early years educator qualification they must also have at least a GCSE grade C in English and maths to undertake a level 3 job role.
     </p>
     <p>
      The position for staff holding full and relevant qualifications prior to the introduction of the early years educator criteria has not changed. They can still practice in level 3 job roles and do not need to hold GCSEs in English and maths.
