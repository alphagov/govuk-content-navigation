         National curriculum tests
        </h2>
        <p>
         A new national curriculum was introduced in 2014. As a result, the Standards and Testing Agency (STA) is changing the tests so that they assess the new curriculum. Pupils will take the new tests for the first time in May 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have published materials to help teachers gain a better understanding of the new tests. The
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum-assessments-test-frameworks">
          test frameworks
         </a>
         explain the structure and content of the tests. We have also published a complete set of
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum-assessments-2016-sample-materials">
          sample key stage 1 (KS1) and key stage 2 (KS2) tests
         </a>
         for English reading, English grammar, punctuation and spelling and mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
         As part of the national curriculum review, levels have been abolished. This is in part in response to concerns about the validity and reliability of levels and sub-levels. These concerns had an impact on pupils’ learning, but also on the relationships between primary and secondary schools and the trust in their assessments. Levels have also been recognised as the driver of undue pace through the curriculum, which has led to gaps in pupils’ knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are changing the way the tests are reported. From 2016, we will use scaled scores to report national curriculum test outcomes. Headteachers won’t need to change the way their school prepares for, or administers, the tests because of the introduction of scaled scores. Within key stages, schools and teachers will have the freedom to assess what pupils understand and can do in a way that best suits the needs of their school.
        </p>
        <h2 id="scaled-scores">
         Scaled scores
        </h2>
        <p>
         The move to scaled scores was announced as part of the previous government’s response to the
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/new-national-curriculum-primary-assessment-and-accountability">
          consultation on reforming assessment and accountability for primary schools
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Scaled scores are used all over the world. They help test results to be reported consistently from one year to the next. We design national curriculum tests to be as similar as possible year on year, but slight differences in difficulty will occur between years. Scaled scores maintain their meaning over time so that two pupils achieving the same scaled score on two different tests will have demonstrated the same attainment. For example, on our scale 100 will always represent the ‘national standard’. However, due to the small differences in difficulty between tests, the ‘raw score’ (ie the total number of correct responses) that equates to 100 might be different (though similar) each year.
        </p>
        <p>
         We can’t give full information about what the scale will look like yet. We need to wait until pupils have taken the tests and the tests have been marked before we can set the national standard and the rest of the scale. We can’t set the scale in advance; this cohort is the first that has reached the end of key stage 2 having studied sufficient content from the new national curriculum. If we were to set the scale using data from pupils that had studied the old national curriculum, it is likely it would be incorrect.
        </p>
        <p>
         We do know the scale will have a lower end point below 100 and an upper end point above 100. Once we have set the national standard we will use a statistical technique called ‘scaling’ to transform the raw score into a scaled score. We will publish this after the first tests have been administered.
        </p>
        <p>
         The standards underpinning the scale will be maintained as long as there is no large-scale change to what the tests cover. Once the national standard has been set in summer 2016, we will maintain the standard in subsequent years by using a process known as ‘test equating’. When we trial future tests in schools, we also administer a separate ‘anchor test’. This test remains the same over time. It allows us to link scores from one test to another to ensure standards are maintained.
        </p>
        <h2 id="interpreting-scaled-scores">
         Interpreting scaled scores
        </h2>
        <p>
         A pupil’s scaled score will be based on their raw score. The raw score is the total number of marks a pupil receives in a test, based on the number of questions they answered correctly. The pupil’s raw score will be translated into a scaled score using a conversion table. A pupil who achieves the national standard will have demonstrated sufficient knowledge in the areas assessed by the tests. This will mean that they are well placed to succeed in the next phase of their education.
        </p>
        <p>
         The typical characteristics of pupils at the national standard are illustrated by the test performance descriptors. These are included in the 2016 KS1 and KS2
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum-assessments-test-frameworks">
          test frameworks
         </a>
         . However, as with all tests, pupils can achieve their marks in a number of different ways. If a pupil achieves the national standard this doesn’t imply that the pupil has mastered all of the knowledge and skills indicated in the test performance descriptor. Headteachers will need to include results from the national curriculum tests in their annual reports to parents. They will need to report the pupil’s scaled score and whether or not they met the national standard.
        </p>
        <p>
         The old national curriculum levels are not relevant to the new national curriculum. However, in order to provide schools with some indication of the new standards, we have tried to indicate equivalence in a broad sense. At KS1 the national standard will roughly equate to an old level 2b. At KS2 this will roughly equate to an old level 4b. Otherwise levels and scaled scores will not be comparable.
        </p>

        <p>
         For 2016 KS1 tests, conversion tables will be published on GOV.UK by the end of May 2016. In future years the marking guidance for the KS1 tests will include conversion tables.
        </p>
        <p>
         Teachers will need to use these to translate pupils’ raw scores into scaled scores to see whether each pupil has met the national standard. You should use the scaled scores to inform your teacher assessment judgements.
        </p>

        <p>
         We will publish KS2 test results on the NCA tools website in July 2016. Each pupil registered for the tests will receive:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          a raw score (number of raw marks awarded)
         </li>
         <li>
          a scaled score
         </li>
         <li>
          confirmation of whether or not they attained the national standard
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         We will also publish conversion tables on GOV.UK at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Currently headteachers can apply for a review of marking if they believe there has been a clerical or marking error which has resulted in a pupil being awarded the wrong level in a test. From 2016, the reviews service will change to reflect the removal of levels. We will give details of the revised reviews service in Autumn 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
         Teachers will be able to use
         <a href="https://www.raiseonline.org/" rel="external">
          RAISEonline
         </a>
         to analyse their pupils’ individual results. Because scaled scores and levels aren’t equivalent, you won’t be able to make comparisons between how your school performs in the 2016 tests and its previous year’s results.
        </p>
        <p>
         Year 7 teachers will be able to view their incoming pupils’ scaled scores so that they can prepare for their new intake.
        </p>
        <p>
         There will continue to be no link between KS2 test results and teacher assessment.

        <h2 id="decisions-on-which-pupils-to-enter-for-the-tests">
         Decisions on which pupils to enter for the tests
        </h2>
        <p>
         We are developing the new tests so that most pupils will be able to engage with some of the questions. The questions will be arranged in order of difficulty. Pupils will still be able to use access arrangements, eg readers or additional time, where appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         We currently advise that pupils who aren’t expected to reach level 2 (KS1) or level 3 (KS2) of the national curriculum by May shouldn’t sit the tests. With the removal of levels, schools will need to use their professional judgement to determine whether it is appropriate for pupils to take the tests. We have published
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum-assessments-2016-sample-materials">
          sample materials
         </a>
         . You can use these to decide which pupils are working below the standard of the tests. These pupils will still be included in the baseline figure when calculating school performance.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you judge that a pupil is secure enough in their learning to take the test, the pupil will receive a scaled score outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past, we have produced level 6 tests for pupils who can demonstrate attainment above level 5. There won’t be separate tests for the most able from 2016. Instead we are developing each test so that there is scope for higher attaining pupils to show their strengths.
