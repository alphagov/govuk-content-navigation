     <p>
      This guide is for all academy trusts and will help you to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       reduce the risk of fraud or financial irregularities
      </li>
      <li>
       deal with fraud within your academy trust, should it occur
      </li>
      <li>
       report fraud, theft and/or irregularity to the Education Funding Agency (
       <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">

       )
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="what-is-fraud">
      What is fraud?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Fraud is deception carried out in order to gain an unfair advantage or to disadvantage another. It may involve the misuse of funds or other resources, or the supply of false information.
     </p>
     <h2 id="types-of-fraud">
      Types of fraud
     </h2>
     <p>
      Although there are low levels of fraud within the academies sector (currently allegations with an outcome of fraud represent less than 1% of the total number of academies), trusts should be vigilant to the risks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Common types of fraud in the UK include theft, fictitious invoices, falsification of invoices and credit card fraud. Trusts should also be vigilant to the increasing risk of cybercrime involving malicious attacks on computer software and email hacking. People can illegally gain access to an email account in various ways, many of which rely on user behaviour, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       opening and responding to spam emails
      </li>
      <li>
       opening emails that contain viruses
      </li>
      <li>
       opening phishing email messages that appear to be from a legitimate business
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Phishing messages look authentic and often have corporate logos and a similar format to official emails, but they ask for verification of personal information such as account numbers, passwords, and dates of birth. Unsuspecting victims who respond may suffer stolen accounts, financial loss and identity theft.

       Malvertising is about compromising your computer, by downloading a short malicious code on to it, when you hover on or click on an advertisement. Some adverts will even download malicious code to your computer, while the website is still loading in the background. Cybercriminals are using advertisements as a means to hack into computers.

       ‘Managing Public Money’

      highlights the responsibilities and expectations of public sector organisations in relation to fraud. An effective fraud risk management strategy will involve:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       assessing the organisation’s overall vulnerability to fraud organisation and test your internal control system to ensure it is robust - the

      The most effective way to manage the risk of fraud is to prevent it from happening by developing an effective anti-fraud culture.

     <h3 id="fraud-response-plan">
      Fraud response plan
     </h3>
     <p>
      An organisation’s response to fraud risk should be customised to the risks it faces. Typically it will involve some or all of the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       developing a fraud policy statement, a fraud risk strategy and a fraud response plan: every organisation should have these documents
      </li>
      <li>
       developing and promoting an anti-fraud culture, for example, through a clear statement of commitment to ethical behaviour to promote awareness of fraud: recruitment screening, training and maintaining good staff morale can also be important
      </li>
      <li>
       clarifying roles and responsibilities for the overall and specific management of fraud risk
      </li>
      <li>
       establishing cost-effective internal systems of control to prevent and detect fraud
      </li>
      <li>
       confirming contacts and routes for staff to report suspicions of fraud, including developing a whistleblowing policy
      </li>
      <li>
       responding quickly and effectively to fraud when it arises
      </li>
      <li>
       establishing systems and processes for investigations into allegations of fraud
      </li>
      <li>
       continuously evaluating the effectiveness of anti-fraud measures in reducing fraud
      </li>
      <li>
       where appropriate, use your internal audit function to advise on fraud risk and draw on their experience to strengthen control
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      It is good practice to measure the effectiveness of actions taken to reduce the risk of fraud. Assurances about these measures can be obtained from internal audit, stewardship reporting, control risk self-assessment and monitoring activity.

      </a>
      confirms trusts must notify

      of any instances of fraud, theft and/or irregularity exceeding £5,000 individually, or £5,000 cumulatively in an academy’s financial year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any unusual or systematic fraud (such as regular occurrences of low value theft), regardless of value, must also be reported. As set out in paragraph 4.8.2 of the Handbook, you will need to notify
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">

      </abbr>
      using the contact form and provide:

     <ul>

      <li>

      The ten questions below are intended to help academy trust governors, accounting officers and heads of finance to review their arrangements for preventing, detecting and dealing with fraud should it occur. The arrangements each trust will have in place will vary according to size, complexity and structure.
     </p>
     <ol id="Anti-fraud-checklist">
      <li>
       Are the trust’s governors and accounting officer aware of the risk of fraud and their responsibilities regarding fraud?
      </li>
      <li>
       Is fraud included within the remit of the trust’s audit committee or equivalent?
      </li>
      <li>
       Has the role of the trust’s external auditor and responsible officer or equivalent regarding fraud been established and is it understood?
      </li>
      <li>
       Is fraud risk considered within the trust’s risk management process?
      </li>
      <li>
       Does the trust have a fraud strategy or policy and is there a ‘zero tolerance’ culture to fraud in the trust?
      </li>
      <li>
       Is the fraud strategy or policy and ‘zero tolerance’ culture promoted within the trust, for example through financial regulations, disciplinary procedures, checks on new staff, induction process, staff training, vetting of contractors?
      </li>
      <li>
       Does the trust have policies on whistleblowing, declaration of interests and receipt of gifts and hospitality?
      </li>
      <li>
       Does the trust have appropriate segregation of duties?
      </li>
      <li>
       Is it clear to whom suspicions of fraud in the trust should be reported?
      </li>
      <li>
       If there has been any fraud in the trust has a ‘lessons learned’ exercise been undertaken?
