       This guidance will be updated for the 2017 test cycle in March.
      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      If a pupil is caught attempting to cheat but did not gain an advantage you do not need to notify us. Instead you should take corrective action for the remainder of the test and deal with the incident using your school’s behaviour policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      If, however, a pupil is caught cheating, and you believe the pupil has gained an advantage as a result, you must notify us using the ‘notification of a pupil cheating form’. This is available on the ‘Access arrangements’ section of the
      <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk" rel="external">
       NCA tools website
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      By completing the form, the headteacher agrees to either:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the removal of marks for the specific questions where the pupil has gained an advantage
      </li>
      <li>
       the annulment of the whole of the pupil’s test paper
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A pupil must have a result for each component of a test to receive an overall test result. This means that if one of the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test or mathematics papers are annulled the pupil will not receive an overall test result in that subject.
     </p>

      Completing the ‘notification of a pupil cheating form’
     </h2>
     <p>
      Use the ‘notification of a pupil cheating form’ to report the incident. You will need to provide the following information:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the pupil’s name
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupil’s unique pupil number (UPN)
      </li>
      <li>
       the name of the test
      </li>
      <li>
       whether you wish to annul the test paper or to remove marks from specific questions
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If you choose to request the removal of marks you will also need to give the specific question numbers in which the pupil was advantaged by cheating.
     </p>
     <p>
      Collate the pupil’s test script(s) with the other pupils test scripts. Information about the incident should not be included with the test scripts.
