      The ‘upper pay range’ is a higher rate of pay for teachers who meet certain conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      We introduced new arrangements for applying for the upper pay range on 1 September 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      Find details about the upper pay range in the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-teachers-pay-and-conditions-2015">
       School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document (

     <h2 id="apply-for-the-upper-pay-range">
      Apply for the upper pay range
     </h2>
     <p>
      You should apply for the upper pay range through your school.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ask your school for a copy of their pay policy. This will explain:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       how to apply for the upper pay range
      </li>
      <li>
       how the process works
      </li>
      <li>
       when to apply and any deadlines
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If you are employed by your local authority, their pay policy will explain how to apply.
     </p>
     <h3 id="teachers-who-have-moved-schools">
      Teachers who have moved schools
     </h3>
     <p>
      If you are  on the upper pay scale and have recently moved schools, you may have to reapply for the upper pay scale. Your new school may accept the previous school’s assessment, or they may want to assess you against their own criteria.
     </p>
     <p>
      If your new school does place you on the upper pay range, they don’t have to match your previous salary.

     <h3 id="schools-maintained-by-the-local-authority">
      Schools maintained by the local authority

     <p>
      All qualified classroom teachers at maintained schools can apply for the upper pay range.

      Teachers on statutory induction can also apply.
     </p>
     <h3 id="teachers-employed-by-a-local-authority">
      Teachers employed by a local authority
     </h3>
     <p>
      You can apply for the upper pay scale if you are an unattached teacher (employed by a local authority, but not attached to a particular school.)
     </p>
     <h3 id="schools-not-maintained-by-the-local-authority">
      Schools not maintained by the local authority

     <p>
      Non-maintained schools don’t have to follow the same rules as maintained schools about teachers’ pay.

     <p>
      If you work at a non-maintained school, including academies and free schools, you should discuss your eligibility and the application process with your school.

     <p>
      Most schools will ask for the results of your appraisals or reviews, including any recommendations on pay.
     </p>
     <h2 id="how-your-school-assesses-your-application">
      How your school assesses your application
     </h2>
     <p>
      The relevant body (usually your school’s governing body) will assess your application to see if you meet the criteria. The
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-teachers-pay-and-conditions-2015">
       <abbr title="The School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document">

      explains how they should do this.
     </p>
     <p>
