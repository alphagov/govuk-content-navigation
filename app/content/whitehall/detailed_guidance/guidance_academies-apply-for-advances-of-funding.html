      Introduction
     </h2>
     <p>
      Academies might occasionally experience short-term negative cash flows. In these circumstances you can request an advance of funding from Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      ) to cover revenue and relevant capital costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      pays funding advances in monthly installments at a value sufficient to meet cash flow needs.
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      can arrange for payments to be made sooner than this to meet urgent needs.
     </p>
     <h2 id="who-this-guide-is-for">

     </h2>
     <p>
      This guide applies to academies, which are public sector, statutory corporations funded by
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      through grant-in-aid or equivalent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      also funds local authorities, businesses and private sector charities but is not responsible for their solvency.
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      will consider advancing funds to them where it is necessary to protect the interests of learners, for example, to secure alternative learning provision.
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      may make emergency payments to business and private sector charities if there has been a payment error.
     </p>
     <h2 id="how-to-apply">
      How to apply
     </h2>
     <p>
      You should contact
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      as soon as you identify that your academy or organisation may need an advance of funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      You must submit a written request, signed by your accounting officer, which sets out:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the circumstances leading to the request
      </li>
      <li>
       the sums needed and dates required
      </li>
      <li>
       a schedule of dates and sums for repayment of the advance, as soon as cash flow permits, but no later than the end of the financial year
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The request should also include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       latest management accounts, including income and expenditure account forecasts, and balance sheet projections
      </li>
      <li>
       monthly cash flow forecasts to the academic year end, following the proposed date of final repayment of the advance, showing timings of major cash receipts and payments
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Submit your request at least 10 working days before the advance needs to be received. This will allow sufficient time for review and processing.

     </h2>
     <p>
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      will review requests for advances of funding  to ensure they are appropriate and the conditions can be met.
     </p>
     <p>
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      will only advance funding to meet an immediate cash need and will only advance the minimum sum necessary.
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      will not advance funding to meet academies’ expenditure if the expenditure can be deferred.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the timing of cash flows is particularly critical we may request an analysis of all or part of the cash flow forecast to a weekly level.
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      may ask to see longer-term financial projections as part of the review process.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      gives approval for a funding advance, we will confirm the terms and conditions. The accounting officer should accept them within 3 working days.
     </p>
     <p>
      Requests for advances of funding may lead to a re-assessment of the academy’s financial management and control arrangements. This reassessment could lead to
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      formally intervening to secure improvements in to these areas.
     </p>
     <h2 id="conditions-of-advances">
      Conditions of advances
     </h2>
     <p>
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      will pay advances of funding in accordance with a demonstrated need to use the advance to remain solvent. A mutually agreed schedule of repayment will be included as a condition of funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      may impose further conditions as appropriate to safeguard public funds. For example, you may be required to submit management accounts and consult with
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      before committing to new expenditure above a certain sum.
     </p>
     <h2 id="repayments">
      Repayments
     </h2>
     <p>
      Advances of funding must be repaid according to the agreed schedule. You should inform
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      as soon as possible if the agreed schedule cannot be met.
     </p>
     <p>
      The longest possible period for an advance is 12 months, but an advance of this duration will be by rare exception. We cannot normally advance funding for longer than this, as such Iong-term advances of funding may constitute a loan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Repayments are made by reducing the value of 1 or more profiled monthly payments.
     </p>
     <p>
      On rare occasions, academies may experience negative cash flow arising from operating deficits. This can result in an inability to repay any advance within a reasonable period. In this case a request for deficit funding might be more appropriate.
     </p>
     <h2 id="accounting-for-advances">
      Accounting for advances
     </h2>
     <p>
      An advance of funding is not an additional grant to an academy or organisation.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should reflect an advance as a liability on your balance sheet and as a cash movement, rather than income, in management accounts and cash flow forecasts.
     </p>
     <h2 id="emergency-or-disaster-support">

      If an academy or organisation suffers catastrophic loss or destruction and needs immediate cash support, we will waive the normal procedures.

     <p>
      An email or telephone request from the principal or most senior available manager can secure same-day transfers if the request is made before 10am.
