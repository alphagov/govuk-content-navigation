      Apprenticeships are work-based training programmes, designed with employers, which combine on and off the job learning and development activities. They are used to develop employees who are in new job roles including higher level roles.
     </p>
     <p>
      This guide has been developed to support small to medium sized employers understand, deliver and develop apprenticeships for their businesses.

      Build an apprenticeship programme
     </h2>
     <p>
      Your business can work with training providers to create an apprenticeship programme.
     </p>
     <p>
      As an employer offering an apprenticeship you need to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       employ an apprentice for a minimum of 30 hours per week
      </li>
      <li>
       pay at least the national minimum wage for apprentices
      </li>
      <li>
       induct the apprentice and support their on-the-job learning using skills and knowledge in the workforce
      </li>
      <li>
       be involved in reviewing the progress of an apprentice
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A training organisation will support an employer to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       identify the apprenticeship that fits your business requirements
      </li>
      <li>
       recruit an apprentice
      </li>
      <li>
       develop a training plan which reflects the apprentice and employer requirements
      </li>
      <li>
       review and test the progress of the apprentice and provide feedback
      </li>
      <li>
       provide training to support the knowledge elements of the programme
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      You should think about including some or all of this content in your apprenticeship:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       on-the-job coaching and learning
      </li>
      <li>
       off-the-job learning
      </li>
      <li>
       employer induction and training
      </li>
      <li>
       online learning and support
      </li>
      <li>
       workbooks
      </li>
      <li>
       projects
      </li>
      <li>
       mentoring and line management support
      </li>
      <li>
       specific training for individuals

      Apprenticeship frameworks
     </h2>
     <p>
      Apprenticeships at all levels must be part of a framework which:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       is a document which covers all the statutory requirements for an apprenticeship programme in England
      </li>
      <li>
       is used by colleges, employers and training providers to make sure that all apprenticeship programmes are delivered consistently to national standards, no matter where in England the apprenticeship takes place
      </li>
      <li>
       includes the names of all qualifications and what each qualification is worth (their “credit value”)
      </li>
      <li>
       gives guidance on how to get onto an apprenticeship programme, the time it will take and career paths available after an apprenticeship
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A list of
      <a href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/partners/frameworks.aspx" rel="external">
       all current frameworks
      </a>
      is produced and regularly updated.
     </p>
     <h3 id="apprenticeship-changes">
      Apprenticeship changes
     </h3>
     <p>
      New arrangements have been put in place to reform apprenticeships so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers. Under our reforms,
      <a href="/government/collections/apprenticeship-standards">
       apprenticeship standards
      </a>
      will replace
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-frameworks-live-list">
       frameworks
      </a>
      , and will be clear and concise.
     </p>
     <h2 id="choose-a-training-provider">
      Choose a training provider
     </h2>
     <p>
      Most employers work in partnership with training providers to deliver their apprenticeship programme. A college or training provider will help you:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       identify the right apprenticeship for your business requirements
      </li>
      <li>
       recruit an apprentice
      </li>
      <li>
       develop a training plan which reflects the apprentice’s and your needs
      </li>
      <li>
       review and test the progress of an apprentice and provide feedback
      </li>
      <li>
       provide training to support the apprentice with off-the-job learning and the knowledge elements of the programme
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A training provider usually holds the apprenticeship delivery contract which is managed by the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/skills-funding-agency">
       Skills Funding Agency
      </a>
      (SFA).
     </p>
     <p>
      You can find the most suitable training provider for your business by thinking about:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       your business area and job role of the programme (and potential frameworks and levels)
      </li>
      <li>
       the size and scope of the programme (numbers, geography and age groups)
      </li>
      <li>
       whether you will integrate your in-house training materials into the programme
      </li>
     </ul>
     <div class="call-to-action">
      <p>
       Employers can use the
       <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.sfa.bis.gov.uk/" rel="external">
        find apprenticeship training service
       </a>
       to search for suitable apprenticeships and identify approved training providers who can deliver that training.
      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      The service contains details of training providers who currently offer apprenticeships.  It will be updated in 2017 to reflect the new register of apprenticeship training providers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once you’ve selected a training provider you should create a Service Level Agreement (SLA) to help build a close working relationship. The SLA should set out the responsibilities and duties of each partner, including measures and deadlines that you’ll both follow. If you’re agreeing a financial contract you’ll need a separate contract in addition to your SLA.

      Apprenticeship training agencies

     <p>
      If you are interested in employing an apprentice but cannot currently commit to the length of time needed for a full apprenticeship, an apprenticeship training agency (ATA) may be the right option for you.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apprenticeship training agencies recruit, employ and arrange training for apprentices on behalf of employers.

     <p>
      Read the

      How apprenticeship funding is paid

     <p>
      Understanding how and when apprenticeship funding is paid can be helpful even if your training provider manages this on your behalf.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payments are made on a monthly basis and are spread across the planned delivery duration of each qualification within the apprenticeship. A percentage of the funding for the competence element of the apprenticeship is paid upon completion of the whole framework.
     </p>
     <p>
      The funding for apprenticeships is changing from May 2017 for more information please visit the
