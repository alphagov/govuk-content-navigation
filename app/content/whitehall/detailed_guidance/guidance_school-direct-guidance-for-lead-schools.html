      Overview
     </h2>
     <p>
      School Direct is a school-led initial teacher training (
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      ) scheme. It is run by a partnership between a lead school, other schools and an accredited teacher training provider.
     </p>
     <p>
      Training places are allocated to the lead school on behalf of the partnership, usually for 1 year. The lead school has overall responsibility for requesting places from the National College for Teaching and Leadership (
      <abbr title="National College for Teaching and Leadership">
       NCTL
      </abbr>
      ) and for ensuring that the criteria for School Direct are met.
     </p>
     <p>
      This information is for lead schools.
     </p>
     <h2 id="types-of-training-places-and-funding">
      Types of training places and funding
     </h2>
     <p>
      There are 2 types of School Direct training places available.
     </p>
     <h3 id="school-direct-tuition-fee-places">
      School Direct (tuition fee) places
     </h3>
     <p>
      These places are open to all graduates and are funded by tuition fees paid by the trainee. Trainees may be eligible for a
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2015-to-16#tuition-fee-routes">
       training bursary or scholarship

      .
     </p>
     <h3 id="school-direct-salaried-places">
      School Direct (salaried) places
     </h3>
     <p>
      These places are aimed mainly at graduates with 3 or more years’ work experience. However, schools can decide to accept applications from people with less work experience to attract high quality candidates in hard to fill subjects. Prospective candidates are expected to be career changers who can bring valuable skills and experience to the teaching profession. This experience does not have to be from an educational setting. For example, experience could have been gained in the financial, engineering or manufacturing sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Trainees are employed as an unqualified teacher.
      <abbr title="National College for Teaching and Leadership">
       NCTL
      </abbr>
      provides
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2015-to-16#school-direct-salaried-route">
       funding to lead schools
      </a>
      to cover training costs and subsidise the trainee salaries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both routes carry the award of qualified teacher status (QTS).
     </p>
     <p>
      When you are deciding on the number and type of places to request, you should consider:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       any previous School Direct recruitment you have undertaken and future employment needs for your school partnership
      </li>
      <li>
       what training you want to provide for your future teachers, including whether you offer a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) or Master’s-level credits in addition to QTS
      </li>
      <li>
       how much you want your school partnership to deliver and which accredited provider or providers can best deliver the training you require
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      You should also take a look at the

      All initial teacher training places – including for School Direct – are advertised through a single application system, operated by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (
      <abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">
       UCAS
      </abbr>
      ). You will manage your training places through this system and you must agree who will handle the process for applications.

      Before applications open on
      <abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">
       UCAS

      Teacher Training, you should agree your overall approach with your partner schools and
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      provider so that your recruitment process is open and fair and you have a clear and effective marketing strategy. You should consider:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       what type of candidates you wish to target and the minimum entry requirements – for example, if you are accepting applications from candidates with less than 3 years’ work experience for School Direct (salaried places) in hard to fill subjects
      </li>
      <li>
       how you will attract high-quality candidates – for example, using your own website, working with your
       <abbr title="initial teacher training">

      On 25 September 2014 the Department for Education announced the 2015 to 2016 financial incentives for postgraduate teacher training. The overall principle of the bursary incentives have not changed, however there have been some changes to the detail of those incentives. These include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       increases to bursaries for trainees with a first in physics, maths, chemistry, computing and languages – from £20k to £25k. Trainees with a 2:1 in physics also receive the same increased bursary
      </li>
      <li>
       increases to bursaries for biology, geography, design and technology, music
      </li>
      <li>
       new bursary introduced for trainees in RE – £9k for a first, £4k for a 2:1
      </li>
      <li>
       bursaries for trainees on primary maths specialist courses extended to trainees on primary maths specialism courses, with minor changes
      </li>
      <li>
       removal of uplift to bursaries for trainees who spend more than 50% of their time in a school with more than 35% free school meals (
       <abbr title="free school meals">
        FSM
       </abbr>
       )
      </li>
      <li>
       removal of the discretionary uplift, which gave teacher training providers and School Direct lead schools discretion to increase the bursary for trainees
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Changes to School Direct (salaried):
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       additional grant funding of £6k available to schools to support salaries of £21k nationally and £25k in inner London on School Direct (salaried) for trainees in maths, physics or computing
      </li>
      <li>
       to reflect bursary changes, the primary maths specialist and specialism grant has increased from £16k to £19k nationally, and grant funding of £14k nationally has been introduced for RE
      </li>
      <li>
       the removal of the 10% grant uplift for trainees who spend more 50% of their time in a school with more than 35%
       <abbr title="free school meals">

      School Direct enables you to develop a tailored training programme, customised to suit the needs of your school and your trainees. With trainees in school from day one, working alongside your existing team, it’s a great opportunity for them to gain insight into life as a teacher and to be supported by those already doing the job.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the partnership agreement with your
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      provider you should decide which elements of the training are going to be provided by the lead school, partner schools and your chosen provider. This should include any fixed locations or days, for example, trainees are always in school on a Monday. You should also think about the best use of expertise available across the school partners and from your
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      provider. For example, you may choose to involve outstanding teachers to provide subject knowledge training and your provider for assessment and quality assurance. You will need to ensure you have the capacity to deliver the aspects of training that you will take on.

     <h2 id="employment">
      Employment
     </h2>
     <p>
      There is an expectation that trainees will be employed as newly qualified teachers (NQTs) in your school partnership once they are qualified. In determining how many School Direct places to request, you should bear this in mind.
     </p>
     <p>
      Trainees can be employed within an individual school or group of schools in which they have been trained.
     </p>
     <p>
      Trainees do not need to be employed in addition to your regular teaching staff numbers; they can be employed in an established post provided there are no risks to the quality of their training.
