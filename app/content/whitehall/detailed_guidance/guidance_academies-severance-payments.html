      Introduction
     </h2>
     <p>
      This guide is for academy trust accounting officers and finance staff considering making special severance payments. It explains what you should consider before making any such payments, and how to seek approval from the Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      ) for payments of or over £50,000, or for any value where an Financial Notice to Improve (
      <abbr title="Financial Notice to Improve">
       FNtI
      </abbr>
      ) is in place.
     </p>
     <p>
      Special severance payments are paid to employees, contractors and others outside of normal statutory or contractual requirements when leaving employment in public service whether they resign, are dismissed or reach an agreed termination of contract. You can read more in section A4.13A of the HM Treasury publication
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-public-money">
       Managing Public Money
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Severance payments, specifically non-contractual elements, are always under close scrutiny. The National Audit Office published a
      <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/report/confidentiality-clauses-and-special-severance-payments/" rel="external">
       report on severance payments
      </a>
      in June 2013 and the Public Accounts Committee
      <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news/confidentiality-clauses-statement/" rel="external">
       followed this up
      </a>
      shortly afterwards.

      What to consider before making any special severance payment
     </h2>
     <p>
      You should:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       review the
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-severance-payments-form">
        academies severance payments form
       </a>
      </li>
      <li>
       read the detailed advice set out in section 3.7 of the
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">
        Academies Financial Handbook

     <p>
      You should then take the following steps:

      Consider whether a special severance payment is appropriate in this case
     </h3>
     <p>
      A severance payment may not always be the right approach: for example, severance payments must not be made to staff with poor performance, and
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      and HM Treasury will not approve such payments.
     </p>
     <h3 id="take-and-document-legalhr-advice">
      Take and document legal/HR advice
     </h3>
     <p>
      Appraise any course of action with the associated costs and the likelihood of winning. If there is a good chance of the academy trust winning the case you will also need to demonstrate why this route was not taken and instead, a payment was made to the employee. You should balance the legal and management costs against the level of payout.
     </p>
     <h3 id="clearly-document-the-management-process">
      Clearly document the management process
     </h3>
     <p>
      This must take account of the academy’s own internal processes and employment law.
     </p>
     <h3 id="consider-the-appropriate-level-of-payment">
      Consider the appropriate level of payment
     </h3>
     <p>
      Following any legal advice, can a change from the settlement value actually be justified? A severance payment is made from the public purse and therefore value for money has to be demonstrated.

     </p>
     <h3 id="confidentiality-clauses">
      Confidentiality clauses
     </h3>
     <p>
      Academy trusts must ensure that the use of confidentiality clauses associated with staff severance payments do not prevent an individual’s right to make disclosures in the public interest (whistleblowing) under the
      <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/23/contents" rel="external">

      may issue a Financial Notice to Improve, which withdraws the academy freedoms. Further information about Financial Notices to Improve can be found in sections 1.5.6 to 1.5.9 of the

      For the financial period up to 31 August 2013 the outcomes were as follows:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       overall, the sample of cases showed that most academies made special severance payments that were regular, proper and good value for money
      </li>
      <li>
       there were 2 cases where the payment could not be approved and this suggests that some academy trusts do not fully understand the requirements

      Section 7.5.1 of the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-accounts-direction">
       Academies Accounts Direction
      </a>
      explains how academies should disclose severance payments within the financial statements. These should be aggregated in staff restructuring costs, within the staff costs note. Further written disclosure is then required for non-statutory/non-contractual payments on an individual basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Academy auditors will verify the value of compensation payments included within the staff costs note as part of the statutory audit and regularity engagement. Auditors will also look at whether prior approval was obtained.

       The Education Funding Agency (EFA) has updated the severance payments form for academy trusts wishing to seek approval for non-contractual payments over £50,000. The main changes to the form are the need to include a financial assessment and the requirement to demonstrate that all alternative options have been explored before deciding to make a non-contractual severance payment.
