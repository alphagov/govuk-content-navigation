      This guidance explains how local authorities (
      <abbr title="local authorities">
       LAs
      </abbr>
      ) should organise monitoring visits to schools administering the 2016 key stage 2 (
      <abbr title="key stage 2">

      ) national curriculum tests and the phonics screening check.

     <p>
      <abbr title="local authorities">
       LAs
      </abbr>
      have a statutory responsibility to monitor the administration of the
      <abbr title="key stage 2">
       KS2
      </abbr>
      national curriculum tests and phonics screening check. Monitoring visits help us to ensure that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the security and confidentiality of test and check materials are maintained
      </li>
      <li>
       the
       <abbr title="key stage 2">

       </abbr>
       tests and phonics screening check are administered correctly and consistently
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      This year, when monitoring the administration of the
      <abbr title="key stage 2">
       KS2
      </abbr>
      tests, local authority monitoring visitors will also be asked to review the security of key stage 1 (
      <abbr title="key stage 1">
       KS1
      </abbr>
      ) test materials, where applicable. They are not expected to observe the actual administration of the
      <abbr title="key stage 1">
       KS1
      </abbr>
      tests.
     </p>
     <p>
      Monitoring visits also give headteachers a formal opportunity to demonstrate how their school is administering the
      <abbr title="key stage 2">
       KS2
      </abbr>
      tests and phonics screening check and maintaining the security of the
      <abbr title="key stage 1">
       KS1
      </abbr>
      test materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      Academies have been asked to choose whether to be monitored by their current
      <abbr title="local authority">
       LA
      </abbr>
      , another
      <abbr title="local authority">

      Independent schools and academies that have chosen not to be monitored by an

      We recommend that each

      gives responsibility to 1 person to act as their monitoring visits co-ordinator. The monitoring visits co-ordinator should:

      <li>
       arrange monitoring visits
      </li>
      <li>
       select monitoring visitors

      <li>
       brief monitoring visitors on the purpose, scope and procedures involved in conducting monitoring visits

     <p>
      Before any monitoring visits take place, you may want to contact all schools within your authority to explain the purpose of the visits. You may give the names of individuals involved in the visits, but you must not identify in advance any specific schools that will be visited.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should make schools aware of this information and the guidance for

      . This is so that schools know what to expect if they receive a monitoring visit.
     </p>
     <p>
      If schools receive a visit and wish to confirm the identity of their visitor(s) they should contact you, for
      <abbr title="local authority">

      At least 10% of maintained schools administering the tests in your authority must receive a visit. This includes:

      Our maladministration team will follow up all instances where a monitoring visitor records an ‘X’, ‘N’ or ‘P’ on a monitoring visit form. If we investigate an allegation of maladministration and have doubts about whether a pupil’s answers represent their own independent and unaided work, test or phonics screening check results may be amended or annulled.
     </p>
     <p>
      If no irregularities were identified during the visit, monitoring visitors must send their completed forms to you by the following dates:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Friday 20 May for
