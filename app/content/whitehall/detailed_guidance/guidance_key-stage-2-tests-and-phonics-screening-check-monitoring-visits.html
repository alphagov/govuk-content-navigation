         Before any monitoring visits take place, you may want to contact all schools within your authority to explain the purpose of the visits. You may give the names of individuals involved in the visits, but you must not identify in advance any specific schools that will be visited.

         Before each monitoring visit you must give your monitoring visitors:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          copies of the phonics screening check monitoring visit form
         </li>

          details of the number of pupils being assessed at the school including any year 2 pupils who are expected to take the check
         </li>
         <li>
          information to show which check materials the school has received
         </li>
         <li>
          copies of the 2016 check materials (these will be available to download from

         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         You should review the data submitted by schools in 2015 in order to identify pupils in year 2 who should be taking the check. 
In May we will email your NCA tools super user a spreadsheet which summarises the materials which each school has received.

        <p>
         There are separate forms for

         monitoring visits.
        </p>
        <p>
         Make sure that your monitoring visitors understand that they must complete all the questions for each school they visit. If an â€˜Xâ€™, â€˜Nâ€™ or â€˜Pâ€™ is entered on the monitoring visit form, or any other irregularities are noticed during the visit, you must record details of the issue and any actions taken on the form. This will help us identify instances where further investigation by you  and / or
         <abbr title="Standards and Testing Agency">
          STA
         </abbr>
         is required.

        <p>
         If a monitoring visitor has placed an â€˜Xâ€™, â€˜Nâ€™ or â€˜Pâ€™ in any box on the monitoring visit form, they should discuss the issue with you immediately. You should then scan and email the monitoring visit form and any annotated delivery notes (where applicable) to
         <abbr title="Standards and Testing Agency">

        </p>
        <p>
         Our maladministration team will follow up all instances where a monitoring visitor records an â€˜Xâ€™, â€˜Nâ€™ or â€˜Pâ€™ on a monitoring visit form. If we investigate an allegation of maladministration and have doubts about whether a pupilâ€™s answers represent their own independent and unaided work, test or phonics screening check results may be amended or annulled.
        </p>
        <p>
         If no irregularities were identified during the visit, monitoring visitors must send their completed forms to you by the following dates:
