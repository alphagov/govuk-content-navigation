      Work in a traffic office is focused on the logistics sector and revolves around getting goods to where they need to go via the correct route and by the allotted time.

      The role of a traffic officer can vary dramatically depending on the size of the company.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are around 17,000 traffic officers currently working in the UK, but many more logistics companies, so it is often quite a broad role encompassing:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       dealing with customer enquiries
      </li>
      <li>
       issuing vehicle keys
      </li>
      <li>
       ensuring the movement of goods by land, air and sea.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employers in logistics are keen to attract a diverse range of new employees to traffic officer roles and there is currently a big push to get more women and unrepresented ethnic groups into the industry.
