       As
       <abbr title="virtual school head">

       funding to benefit your looked-after children.

        make sure that schools,
        <abbr title="alternative provision">

       </li>

        work with each looked-after child’s educational setting to agree how pupil premium funding will be spent to meet the needs identified in the child’s personal education plan (
        <abbr title="personal education plan">

      <p>
       In most cases, you’ll give schools and early years providers the pupil premium or
       <abbr title="early years pupil premium">
        EYPP
       </abbr>
       for every looked-after child in their care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on the circumstances you can either:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        pass on the full amount of pupil premium or
        <abbr title="early years pupil premium">
         EYPP
        </abbr>
        you receive for a particular child to their school or early years provider (in the case of school-age children, you will get £1,900 per looked-after child every year)
       </li>
       <li>
        pass on less than the full amount
       </li>
       <li>
        pass on more than the full amount
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You should make this decision by talking to the child’s school or early years provider. Ask them how they’ll use the funding to meet the child’s needs (which will be described in their
       <abbr title="personal education plan">
        PEP
       </abbr>
       ).

      <h3 id="when-to-pool-the-funding">
       When to pool the funding
      </h3>
      <p>
       You can pool some pupil premium or
       <abbr title="early years pupil premium">
        EYPP
       </abbr>
       to fund activities that will benefit a group of or all of the authority’s looked-after children.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, you could use the premium to fund training for a group of designated teachers across your authority. You could also pool a portion of the premium to run an activity that all the primary-aged looked-after children in your local authority can participate in.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also suggest that a school or early years provider pools its pupil premium for looked-after children with the rest of its pupil premium funding. This would be to provide more complete support to all the disadvantaged children in the school or early years setting.

       How to spend funding you have not distributed to schools
      </h3>
      <p>
       If you retain any pupil premium or
       <abbr title="early years pupil premium">
        EYPP
       </abbr>
       funding centrally, don’t use the funding for services that your local authority is responsible for funding, such as support for foster carers, school uniforms or transport to get the child to school.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you can use pupil premium or
       <abbr title="early years pupil premium">
        EYPP
       </abbr>
       funding to pay for activities that will:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        improve the way you determine the learning targets in children’s
        <abbr title="personal education plans">
         PEPs
        </abbr>
        , so that
        <abbr title="personal education plans">
         PEPs
        </abbr>
        are always useful and relevant
       </li>
       <li>
        encourage looked-after children to be more involved and interested in their education
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       For instance, one local authority is using some pupil premium funding to hire
       <abbr title="personal education plan">
        PEP
       </abbr>
       champions. These champions help to make sure
       <abbr title="personal education plans">
        PEPs
       </abbr>
       set clear targets so looked-after children get better results in school.

      <p>
       Another
       <abbr title="virtual school head">
        VSH
       </abbr>
       is using some pupil premium funding to train school staff in understanding how children build relationships and form attachments with trusted adults, as well as the impact this can have  on their learning.
