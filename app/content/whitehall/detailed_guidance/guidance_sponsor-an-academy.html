       An academy sponsor is an organisation or person who has received approval from the Department for Education (
       <abbr title="Department for Education">
        DfE
       </abbr>
       ) to support an underperforming academy or group of academies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sponsors work with the academies they support through the academy trust. An academy trust is the charitable company that runs an academy or a group of academies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any of the following can apply to become an academy sponsor:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        schools
       </li>
       <li>
        further education colleges
       </li>
       <li>
        sixth-form colleges
       </li>
       <li>
        universities
       </li>
       <li>
        businesses and entrepreneurs
       </li>
       <li>
        educational foundations

       <li>

       </li>
       <li>
        faith communities
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Academy sponsors are responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        setting up the academy trust
       </li>
       <li>
        appointing the leadership team
       </li>
       <li>
        selecting the governing body
       </li>
       <li>
        monitoring the academy’s performance and taking action where necessary
       </li>
       <li>

       Get consent
      </h3>
      <p>
       If you’re an academy, you must ask your academy trust to pass a resolution to show that they agree with your plans to become a sponsor.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you’re a state-funded school that isn’t an academy, you’ll need to do the following before you can apply to become a sponsor:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        get approval from your governing body to become a sponsor
       </li>
       <li>

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If your school has a religious character, you’ll also need to get approval from your relevant religious body (for example, the local diocese for a church school) before you can apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other organisations or individuals don’t need to show that they have consent.
