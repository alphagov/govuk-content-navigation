      Introduction
     </h2>
     <p>
      Multi-academy trusts (MATs) and some other groups of academy trusts with at least 5 academies and more than 3,000 pupils, receive a School Condition Allocation (SCA) to deploy strategically across their estate to address their priority maintenance needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Academies that are not part of a qualifying MAT or opted-in chain can apply to the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/condition-improvement-fund">
       Condition Improvement Fund
      </a>
      (CIF). In any given financial year, all schools eligible for capital funding will either (i) receive a formulaic allocation via their MAT or chain, or (ii) be able to bid to CIF.

     <p>
      EFA provides funding to keep school buildings in good condition so pupils can learn in a safe and effective environment. SCA should be used to keep academy buildings safe and in good working order by tackling poor building condition, building compliance, energy efficiency and health and safety issues. Further advice can be found in

      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      As the bodies responsible for schools’ sites, organisations that receive SCA need to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       carry out their duties under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and comply with all relevant building regulations. This includes management of asbestos where relevant. You can read guidance about
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asbestos-management-in-schools--2">
        asbestos management in schools
       </a>
      </li>
      <li>
       understand in detail the data relating to the current condition of your estate and develop a long-term asset management strategy
      </li>
      <li>
       maintain the estate for the long-term by renewing and modernising key building elements through preventative works and replacement when they are beyond economic repair

      are currently under review for 2017 to 2018.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is important to note:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       The capital grant should be spent by the end of the financial year in which it has been paid (31 March).
      </li>
      <li>
       The grant will normally be paid in nine equal instalments from May to January.
      </li>
      <li>
       After the end of the financial year, EFA will ask organisations who receive SCA s to provide information about how they have used their funding for that year and what projects they have funded in their schools.
      </li>
      <li>
       We may also ask for information on how organisations are planning, prioritising and managing their SCA
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="salix-type-loans">
      Salix type loans
     </h2>
     <p>
      All MATS and their academies can apply to the latest
      <a href="http://www.salixfinance.co.uk/loans/SEEF" rel="external">
       Salix Energy Efficiency Fund
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Given the importance of achieving energy savings, MATs may also consider using their flexibility to transfer funding from their allocation across the estate to support energy saving projects in their individual academies.
     </p>
     <p>
      MATs can return any savings achieved through capital projects (for example through energy efficiency projects) by transferring revenue funding over and above any funds retained for shared services. This could be a way of building up a sinking fund to assist investment across the estate over a longer period of time. Alternatively, MATs may choose to allow their academies to keep any savings for re-investment within the academy.

     <h2 id="pfi-academies">
      PFI academies
     </h2>
     <p>
      In most cases condition work and maintenance issues in a PFI academy should be covered by the contract with the PFI provider. For expansion projects at these academies, MATs will need to negotiate with the PFI provider about their plans, to determine the willingness of the provider to take on the project, or their willingness for a third party coming on site to complete the works for an additional standalone block or similar. The trust will need to consider the costs of any proposed development in light of the negotiations with the PFI provider and assure themselves that it represents good value for money.

       The MAT Capital Funding Network was set up in 2013 by trusts receiving a capital funding allocation from EFA. Now known as

        The Trust Network

      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      The network is led, managed and administered by MATs, not by EFA. Its remit is ‘To provide members with opportunities to explore how to develop effective, efficient and economically sustainable systems that maintain and develop building estates that enhance teaching and learning.’ This objective is delivered through regular meetings and events, peer support, and sharing information and expertise.
