      Multi-academy trusts (
      <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">
       MATs

      ) with at least 5 academies and more than 3,000 pupils will receive a capital funding allocation to deploy strategically across their estate to address their priority maintenance and expansion needs. You can read more information here about

      a copy of their condition dashboard that explains how the data collected by the

      Allocations for
      <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">

      Use of funding
     </h2>
     <p>
      EFA provides funding to keep school buildings in good condition so pupils can learn in a safe and effective environment. As the body responsible for your schools’ sites, trusts will also need to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       carry out your duties under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and comply with all relevant building regulations. This includes management of asbestos where relevant. You can read guidance about
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asbestos-management-in-schools--2">
        asbestos management in schools
       </a>
      </li>
      <li>
       understand in detail the data relating to the current condition of your estate and develop a long-term asset management strategy
      </li>
      <li>
       maintain the estate for the long-term by renewing and modernising key building elements through preventative works and replacement when they are beyond economic repair
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      At the end of the 2015 to 2016 financial year, EFA will ask trusts to provide information about how they have used their funding for that year and what projects they have funded in their schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      The information will be simple, high-level and easily accessible to schools and the wider public. You can download a draft
      <a href="http://www.emcsrv.com/prolog/EFA/SCA-reporting-draft-template.xls" rel="external">
       school condition allocations template
      </a>
      that shows the information we intend to collect.

      <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">

      receiving a condition funding allocation cannot make separate applications for energy and heating projects funded through Salix. This is because allocations are drawn from the same funding source used to support Salix loans. A
      <abbr title="multi-academy trust">
       MAT
      </abbr>
      receiving an allocation and a loan would be double funded.
     </p>
     <p>
      Given the importance of achieving energy savings,
      <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">
       MATs
      </abbr>
      may consider using their flexibility to transfer funding from their allocation across the estate to support energy saving projects in their individual academies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">
       MATs
      </abbr>
      can return any savings achieved through capital projects (for example through energy efficiency projects) by transferring revenue funding over and above any funds retained for shared services. This could be a way of building up a sinking fund to assist investment across the estate over a longer period of time. Alternatively,
      <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">
       MATs
      </abbr>
      may choose to allow their academies to keep any savings for re-investment within the academy.
     </p>
     <h2 id="pfi-academies">
      PFI academies
     </h2>
     <p>
      In most cases condition work and maintenance issues in a PFI academy should be covered by the contract with the PFI provider. For expansion projects at these academies,
      <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">
       MATs
      </abbr>
      will need to negotiate with the PFI provider about their plans, to determine the willingness of the provider to take on the project, or their willingness for a third party coming on site to complete the works for an additional stand alone block or similar. The trust will need to consider the costs of any proposed development in light of the negotiations with the PFI provider and assure themselves that it represents good value for money.
