     <p>
      We provide training bursaries and training grants to attract high-quality graduates to become early years teachers.

      This funding can only be used in delivering training programmes to support trainees in meeting the

      Graduate entry (full-time)
     </h3>
     <p>
      This is for graduates studying full-time. Training is typically over a 1 year period.
     </p>
     <p>
      A training grant of £7,000 is available to cover course fees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Trainees with high academic achievement may be eligible to receive a
      <a href="#bursary-rates">
       bursary
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      You’ll receive the:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       grant funding on behalf of trainees to cover course fees
      </li>
      <li>
       bursaries to pass on to your trainees
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="graduate-employment-based-part-time">
      Graduate employment based (part-time)
     </h3>
     <p>
      This route is for graduates in paid employment in an early years setting who require training and further experience to demonstrate the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-teachers-standards">
       Teachers’ Standards (Early Years)
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Training is part-time and typically takes place over a one year period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funding of £14,000 is available for this route. This will consist of:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       £7,000 grant funding - you keep this to cover all training course fees
      </li>
      <li>
       up to £7,000 employer incentive - you pass this on to your trainee’s employer
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      There’s no set list of activities for the employer incentive. It’s intended to contribute towards costs incurred by the employer in supporting and employing the trainee during their training and could include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       supply cover
      </li>
      <li>
       salary enhancements
      </li>
      <li>
       employment costs
      </li>
      <li>
       National Insurance and other overheads
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Funding can’t be used for sickness and maternity/paternity pay arrangements; this is the employer’s responsibility.
     </p>
     <p>
      We recommend that you reimburse employers on a term-by-term basis in arrears unless you’ve agreed alternative arrangements. You must keep clear, accurate and up-to-date records of the payments that have been made to employers.

     <h3 id="undergraduate-entry-full-time">
      Undergraduate entry (full-time)

      Funding principles
     </h2>
     <p>
      All allocated funding is based on full-time places. A trainee is defined as full-time if their full-time equivalence (
      <abbr title="Full-time equivalence">
       FTE
      </abbr>
      ) is more than 0.5. Trainees with an
      <abbr title="Full-time equivalence">
       FTE
      </abbr>
      of 0.5 or less will be classified as part-time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Trainees are funded for the number of days between the start date and the planned end date of their training (unless the trainee withdraws). This includes weekends and bank holidays. It also applies to trainees who start their training during the current academic year but aren’t due to complete until a later academic year.
     </p>
     <p>
      All training costs must be met from the funding provided by
      <abbr title="National College for Teaching and Leadership">
       NCTL
      </abbr>
      per trainee and additional fees cannot be charged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funding is ring-fenced for each individual route allocation. For example, graduate entry allocated places can’t be used to recruit graduate employment based trainees.
     </p>
     <p>
      You may only use your allocated places for trainees who are eligible for our funding as defined in your grant offer agreement. All trainees on funded routes must have the right to study or work in the UK for at least the duration of training.
     </p>
     <p>
      We’ll not fund applicants who’ve previously:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       undertaken training and did not meet the standards
      </li>
      <li>

     </ul>
     <h3 id="withdrawals">
      Withdrawals
     </h3>
     <p>
      Trainees who withdraw from their programme attract funding between the start date of their training and the date of withdrawal. We’ll recover any unused funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should suspend bursary payments to withdrawn trainees immediately. However, eligible trainees are entitled to be paid the training bursary for each month up to, and including, the full month in which they withdrew.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should calculate the amount of unused training grant funding, bursary and employer incentive payments from the point of withdrawal. You must be able to demonstrate how you have calculated this.
     </p>
     <p>
      We’ll not reimburse you for any payments made in error for trainees who have already withdrawn. We expect you to recover any overpayment from trainees and employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Withdrawal data should be updated in our

      If a trainee defers during their programme, we’ll continue to fund you for the trainee throughout the period of deferment up to the maximum of training grant and bursary or employer incentive awarded. The deferral period is a maximum of 1 year. A trainee might seek deferment more than once during the course of their training, which should be agreed with you.  Should a trainee wish to defer for more than one year this must be agreed with us.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the deferral period you should hold on to the funding to be used when the trainee returns to their course. However, if the trainee subsequently doesn’t return to the training programme within the one year deferral period we’ll recover any surplus funding unless it has been agreed with us.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deferral data should be updated in our

      The Department for Education’s grant funding agreement underpins the funding arrangements for early years

      . This includes arrangements to recover unused funding and assurance processes. Your grant offer letter will incorporate financial expectations.

     <p>
      Evidence that the monies are being spent appropriately will be sought through an annual grant report process. You’re not required to complete a separate certificate of expenditure.  Assurance could also be gained through internal processes linked to the accreditation process such as internal visits and
