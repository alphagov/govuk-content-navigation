      As an electrical and electronic servicing apprentice you will choose your area of specialisation:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       signal reception, which deals with aerial systems in residences and blocks of flats
      </li>
      <li>
       consumer/commercial electronics, such as TVs, audio systems and DVD players
      </li>
      <li>
       domestic electrical appliances like washing machines, microwaves and refrigerators
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Whichever specialisation you choose, you will cover installation, servicing and maintenance procedures.
     </p>
     <p>
      For this career, you’ll need a keen interest in technology, good analytical skills to work out what’s causing a device to fail, and practical skills to fix it. A lot of the work involves identifying cables and components by colour, so normal colour vision is important.

      On the advanced apprenticeship, you can complete optional courses in water supply, building regulations and a certificate in engineering.

     <p>
      Typical duties of an apprentice could include installing aerial systems and satellite television receivers, servicing DAB radios and CD players, enhancing existing aerial systems to receive digital television, and maintaining home laundry appliances. While some people work on call, there are lots of people employed by the manufacturers themselves and high street retailers.
