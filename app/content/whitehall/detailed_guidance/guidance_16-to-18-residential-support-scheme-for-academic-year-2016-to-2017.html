      In the 2015 to 2016 academic year, the
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      delivery model changed from a nationally managed applications model to an allocation based model. Previously, the nationally administered model required institutions to verify local availability of the substantial qualification with each student’s home local authority. This process was cumbersome and resulted in inconsistent decisions being taken about which students were and were not eligible for
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      . In the 2015 to 2016 academic year, the process was changed so verification was undertaken directly by Education Funding Agency (EFA). This has made the process simpler for institutions and eligibility decisions more consistent.
     </p>
     <p>
      This delivery model will remain in place for the 2016 to 2017 academic year.

     <p>
      Students must have been offered a place on a full-time study programme including either a first full Level 2 or first full Level 3 substantial qualification/s. The programme must be directly 16 to 19 funded by EFA. The local availability of the substantial qualification for each student must be verified with EFA before eligibility for
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      is confirmed.  Study programmes delivered by institutions that have a sub-contracting relationship with an EFA funded institution are not eligible for
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions should refer to
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance">
       EFA Funding Regulations
      </a>
      for the 2016 to 2017 academic year for further information.
     </p>
     <p>
      The full Level 2 or full Level 3 substantial qualification should normally be the student’s first qualification at those levels. However, support for repeat qualifications may be offered in exceptional circumstances, for example, if a student:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       wishes to pursue a second Level 2 which is vocational where their first Level 2 was an academic qualification
      </li>
      <li>
       holds a Level 2 qualification but is required by the institution to undertake a further specific Level 2, in order to progress into the necessary Level 3 element of the programme
      </li>
      <li>
       is planning to enter higher education and a second level 3 qualification is specified as part of the entry requirement
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      It is the responsibility of institutions to assess where exceptions to the first full Level 2 or first full Level 3 substantial qualification criteria are appropriate. Any such support must be a genuine exception; EFA does not expect such support to be given from
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      funding on a routine basis. Institutions should refer to EFA if they have any doubts about particular cases.

      Substantial qualification which is not available within reasonable daily travelling distance
     </h3>
     <p>
      The substantial Level 2 or Level 3 qualification that is part of the student’s study programme must not be available within reasonable daily travelling distance of the student’s home address. For the purposes of
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      eligibility, the key element of the study programme is the substantial qualification that is being funded by EFA, not the study programme as a whole/the combination of different modules within it. If the substantial qualification is available within daily travelling distance the student is not eligible for
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reasonable daily travelling distance is defined as a daily return journey that takes 2 hours or less on public transport; or a distance of under 15 miles from the student’s home or term-time lodgings to the institution.

      Students must apply for
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      in each academic year they require support from the scheme. This is to enable the institution to re-confirm that the student still meets the household income criterion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a student has changed from their original study programme, ie from the substantial qualification the institution verified with EFA, the institution will need to ask EFA to verify whether the student remains eligible for
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      for the new substantial qualification.  For students who are continuing on a substantial qualification already verified with EFA (returning for their second or subsequent year), no further verification of the qualification is needed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Students must have an unconditional offer of a place before they submit an application to the institution for
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      support. Applications may be made after the student has started their study programme but awards may only be backdated to the beginning of the term in which they made the application.
     </p>
     <p>
      Students should apply for
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      directly from the institution. Institutions should develop an application form which students can complete to seek
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      funding.  They may wish to continue to use the example application form provided by EFA in the 2015 to 2016 academic year (updated for the new academic year as appropriate) or use/develop an alternative application form. All application forms used for
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      must capture all the information required to assess the student against the eligibility requirements set out in this guide.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is important for audit purposes that the student and responsible adult(s) sign and date the
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      application form.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions should ensure that a copy of the student’s tenancy agreement has been included with the application form. This must have been agreed and signed and include the following information:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the student’s name
      </li>
      <li>
       the student’s term time address
      </li>
      <li>
       the dates of the tenancy
      </li>
      <li>
       the cost of the rent
      </li>
      <li>
       the landlord’s name, address and signature (please note: the landlord cannot be related to the student)
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The student’s term time lodgings must be no further than 15 miles from campus.

     <p>
      No
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      payments should be released until all of the required information/evidence has been supplied and the application has been fully assessed, including confirmation from EFA that the student meets the criterion for the substantial qualification.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions must ensure that payments are made directly to eligible students’ landlords for their rental costs. 
Proof of payment should be retained for audit purposes. Payments must not be made to students.
     </p>
     <p>
      As an exception, in a scenario where a student has already paid some of their rent, prior to their
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      application being approved, institutions may refund their costs, as long as the rental period they have paid for is within the agreed period of the
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">

      On receipt of the verification form, EFA will assess whether the substantial Level 2 or 3 qualifications each student is enrolled on is available within daily travelling distance of their home address. It is the availability of the substantial EFA funded qualification - not the study programme as a whole - that will determine whether the student meets the criterion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Confirmation of eligibility or a rejection letter will be sent to the institution within 7 working days.
Institutions must retain a copy of EFA’s response as part of their auditable records.
     </p>
     <p>
      The local availability of the substantial qualification for each student must be verified with EFA before eligibility for
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">

      </abbr>
      is confirmed.  Institutions must not make any payments before eligibility has been confirmed by EFA.

     <p>
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">

      funding for a student’s accommodation costs may only be released by institutions when EFA has verified that the substantial qualification is not available locally. If the student transfers or fails to attend the agreed provision
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      funding should be withdrawn immediately. This action should be documented and included in the October MI return.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where EFA rejects an application because the substantial qualification is available within daily travelling distance, the institution must reject the student’s application. No
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">

      payments can be made to any students who have not been confirmed as eligible by EFA.

     <p>
      If a student is returning to the second or subsequent year of their study programme and is continuing on the same qualification into their second year, the institution does not need to seek EFA verification again. 
Continuing student will still need to meet the household income criterion.

     <p>
      The course verification form for the 2016 to 2017 academic year includes a second pre-populated sheet which institutions must use to notify EFA that students have returned as planned.

      Allocations

     <p>
      Allocations have been generated by using the information submitted by institutions on the 2015 to 2016 academic year course verification proforma.  The methodology takes account of the number of eligible students who received
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      support and who will be returning in the 2016 to 2017 academic year multiplied by the maximum permitted funding amount per student (as set out in the Household Income section of this guide).  An amount of funding has then been added to this total to make funds available for any eligible new students in the 2016 to 2017 academic year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only institutions with new

      </abbr>
      allocation in the 2016 to 2017 academic year that are approached by a student for help with residential costs should follow the normal EFA business case process to request an allocation. The business case should provide the student(s) home postcode and details of their substantial Level 2 or 3 qualifications (including qualification reference number) to enable EFA to check if the student is eligible (subject to the institution’s assessment of their household income etc).
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions should use the funding allocated to them for
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      solely to support eligible students with residential costs in line with the
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">

      scheme rules. The funding cannot be used for any other purpose.

      EFA will ask institutions to complete a short management information return in October to report the number of new and returning students who received
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      and the amount of funding spent. As is the case with the residential bursary fund, any unspent funds will be recovered. Data supplied in this return will be crucial to the generation of future allocations.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the longer term, EFA will use data from the ILR (Learner Funding and Monitoring (FAM); learner support reason) to identify students who have been assessed as eligible for
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS
      </abbr>
      and who have taken up the funding to generate subsequent allocations. Institutions are strongly encouraged to complete these fields. EFA will review data periodically throughout the year including R14. This information will enable the development of
      <abbr title="Residential Support Scheme">
       RSS

      policy and help target

      funding is also subject to EFA checks using data submitted as part of the

      </abbr>
      process (to verify student eligibility) and external visits as part of the normal assurance arrangements for 16 to 19 education and training. Institutions should note that, following an audit/check, funding may be recovered where
