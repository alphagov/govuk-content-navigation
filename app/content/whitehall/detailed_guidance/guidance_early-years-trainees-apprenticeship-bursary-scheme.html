     <p>
      Employers need to complete a declaration form as part of the application process. This confirms the candidate’s eligibility to apply for the bursary.

     </h2>
     <p>
      To be eligible for the additional £300 training allowance, applicants need to submit a business case to the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL). This should identify relevant training to enhance the apprentice’s ability to work in early years.
     </p>
     <p>
      On request, NCTL will send the business case form to the applicant’s employer.
