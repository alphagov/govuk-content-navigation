      16 to 19 Bursary Funds are subject to assurance as part of the normal assurance arrangements for 16 to 19 education and training. Institutions should ensure they have appropriate processes in place to record bursary applications and awards (including the number, value, purpose, whether awarded or not, and a brief justification for the decision).  The
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-for-2016-to-2017">
       16 to 19 Bursary Fund guide for the 2016 to 2017
      </a>
      academic year provides more information and should be read in conjunction with this document. The guide also explains the relationship between the funding allocations for the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund and Free Meals in further education, specifically the removal of the ring fence between the 2 schemes for the 2016 to 2017 academic year for institutions that receive both types of funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although this guide is not mandatory, local authorities should familiarise themselves with the audit processes and the error criteria for the 2016 to 2017 academic year that it sets out.
     </p>
     <p>
      To assist local authority auditors, copies of the documentation used by the Funding Agencies Shared Services Team are provided as part of this guide.  Local authority auditors may wish to use these when assessing if 16 to 19 Bursary Funds have been used appropriately. The working papers comprise a brief controls questionnaire  and a suggested substantive testing programme. The working papers are to record any actual payment errors which are identified at audit, and to record any audit findings and suggestions for improvement, together with the institution’s comments.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the 2016 to 2017 academic year the Funding Agencies Shared Services Team has determined that, when undertaking its own audits of bursary funding, institutions will be given a 5 day grace period in which to resolve any errors the audit identifies. Local authorities may choose to offer institutions this same 5 day grace period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where an error is identified and recovery action has not been carried out by the institution, the auditor is requested to contact
      <a href="mailto:jayne.lievesley@education.gov.uk">
       Jayne Lievesley
      </a>
      in EFA’s Student Support team with details of the error. EFA will then decide what to recover and how.
     </p>
     <h2 id="introduction">
      Introduction
     </h2>
     <p>
      This document is an audit guide, produced by EFA and designed to help local authorities in gaining assurance over the funding paid to them in respect of the 16 to19 Bursary Fund during the 2016 to 2017 academic year. It is addressed to all local authorities in receipt of EFA funding and will be of interest to local authority chief financial officers, directors of children’s services, heads of children’s services finance and heads of internal audit.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is important for local authorities to note that this guide is not mandatory. Local authorities must consider the risks to funding and the need for assurance in respect of their own direct provision, including local authority maintained schools with sixth forms, but it is for chief financial officers to determine whether and how any work should be undertaken to enable them to make their grant returns to EFA. The use of all, part or none of this guide to enable them to do so is entirely at their discretion.
     </p>

     </h2>
     <p>
      The purpose of the audit approach set out in this guide is to gain assurance that the institution has an appropriate system of controls in place to effectively administer 16 to 19 Bursary Fund payments to students, thereby ensuring that these payments are made in accordance with EFA requirements set out in the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-for-2016-to-2017">
       16 to 19 Bursary Fund Guide for 2016 to 2017 academic year
      </a>
      , published in April 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is suggested that, where possible, local authorities should consider an integrated approach to individual audits at institutions; that is, undertaking the audit of 16 to 19 Bursary Funding when they visit an institution to perform audit work in other areas, for example, the funding audit at maintained school sixth-forms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Assurance over 16 to 19 Bursary Funding may be obtained in a number of different ways, for example, controls review/evaluation with walkthrough/compliance testing and/or the substantive testing of individual students. It is entirely at the discretion of individual local authorities which type of audit testing, or combination of testing, they choose to undertake.
     </p>
     <p>
      To assist local authority auditors, a brief controls questionnaire is provided alongside this document; this sets out the key areas where assurance is needed and may be completed through discussions with the institution. Identified control weaknesses and suggestions for improvement should be reported to the institution through completion of the relevant column in the document.  Auditors should note that the questionnaire (and other documents noted below) for the 2016 to 2017 academic year include both bursary funding and free meals in further education.

      A suggested substantive testing programme is also provided alongside this document for use by local authorities who decide to undertake this type of testing as part of their audit approach. This sets out detailed checks which ensure funding is being used appropriately. The number of students to be included in the substantive testing sample should be determined by the local authority auditors.

      When undertaking its own audits of 2016 to 2017 bursary funding, EFA has determined that institutions will be given a 5 day grace period in which to resolve any errors identified during the audit; for example, due to missing evidence or documentation. Local authorities may wish to adopt the same approach, but again it is emphasised that this is not compulsory.
     </p>
     <p>
      The working papers may be used to record any actual payment errors which are identified, and the auditor should determine whether the institution has carried out any recovery action.  There is one document for each of free meals in further education (though local authorities will not particularly need to use this), 16 to 19 vulnerable bursaries and 16 to 19 discretionary bursaries.

      Error criteria
     </h3>
     <p>
      The error criteria which will lead to a recovery of funds if they are not met during an audit by EFA’s Risk Analysis division, and which apply to all institutions administering the 16 to19 Bursary Fund in the 2016 to 2017 academic year, are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       each individual students applying for a bursary (both a vulnerable student bursary and a discretionary bursary) must be assessed to determine their eligibility, funds will be recovered if the institution is not able to demonstrate at audit how their students meet the eligibility criteria (see Note 1 below)
      </li>
      <li>
       in any circumstances where the institution has claimed vulnerable bursary payments for duplicate students and/or cannot evidence that no duplicate payments have been made
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Note 1: In relation to the first bullet point above, EFA believes that an institution should be able to demonstrate that its assessment of a student’s eligibility has covered the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the general eligibility criteria (set out in the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund guide and EFA Funding Guidance 2016 to 2017; that is age, residency (see Note 2 below) and type of provision
      </li>
      <li>
       where applicable, the specific criteria for receipt of a vulnerable bursary (set out in the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund guide)
      </li>
      <li>
       where applicable, the specific criteria for receipt of a discretionary bursary (set out in the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund guide), these criteria are to be determined by the institution itself and may, for example, be based on the evidenced level of the student’s household income
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Note 2: In the case of residency checks, where auditors find that these checks have not been carried out by an institution, or that these checks have not been evidenced, EFA suggests that they should advise the institution in their feedback that they should be carrying out residency checks and that these checks must be evidenced.  For a first audit where such an error is found, auditors are advised to treat this as a control issue and EFA will not recover funding.  However, if the same issue reoccurs at any subsequent audit, funding will be recovered.
