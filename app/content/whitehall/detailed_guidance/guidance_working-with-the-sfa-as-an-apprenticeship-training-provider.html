      You may also wish to become an apprentice assessment organisation. The
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-apprentice-assessment-organisations">
       register of apprentice assessment organisations
      </a>
      is a list of organisations that have been assessed as being suitable to conduct independent end-point assessment of apprentices and be in receipt of public funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer will be asked to select an end point assessment organisation from this register to support the delivery of their apprenticeship standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      End-point assessment is separate to any qualifications or other assessment that the apprentice may undertake during training.
     </p>
     <p>
      Assessments will either be delivered by an independent third party or in such a way that no party who has been involved in delivery of the apprenticeship can make the sole decision on competence and passing the end-point assessment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Higher education institutions are the assessment organisations for integrated degree apprenticeships.

     <p>
      The costs for any end point assessment will be included in the total price for the apprenticeship you agree with the employer. You will be required to pass this agreed amount on to the assessment organisation selected by the employer.

      We will publish a guide to the ILR to help you report on your new apprenticeship starts from May 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once you have your ILR file, you should submit it to
      <a href="https://hub.fasst.org.uk/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">
       the Hub
      </a>
      at the correct time.
     </p>
     <p>
      You will need to assign a Hub super user who can manage the data roles within your organisation. We have published
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-the-hub">
       a guide to user roles

     <p>
      We supply an ILR learner entry tool software free of charge to providers who need to submit ILR data to the SFA but who do not have access to a data management system.
     </p>
     <p>
      We will update this software before you are required to submit your first data return for new apprenticeship starts in June 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can download the ILR learner entry tool from

      Data on the digital apprenticeship service
     </h3>
     <p>
      You will need to confirm some information about the apprentices and the training that you are providing on the digital apprenticeship service.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both you and the employer will need to confirm that this information is correct.
     </p>
     <p>
      We will check this information against your ILR data before payments are made.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer may want you to enter details of the learners for them on the digital apprenticeship service. You will be able to do this on screen or through a data upload.

     <h3 id="higher-education-institutions">
      Higher education institutions
     </h3>
     <p>
      If you are a higher education institution, you will need to submit a monthly ILR return as well as your regular HESA student record.
     </p>
     <p>
      HESA has worked with the SFA to create a mechanism for simplifying the production of the ILR record.
     </p>
     <p>
      For 2016 to 2017, an ILR schema compatible output file containing the relevant students can be produced from the submission of the HESA student record. You can then upload  this ILR file to
      <a href="https://hub.fasst.org.uk/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">
       the Hub
      </a>
      .
