      P scales are statutory for pupils with

       SEND

      who are working below the interim pre-key stage standard defined for
      <abbr title="key stage 1">
       KS1
      </abbr>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      P scales have been reviewed during the second phase of the Rochford Review and the group’s recommendations will be published in due course. P scales will stay in place for 2016.

      When to apply P scales
     </h3>
     <p>
      The performance descriptors for P1i–P3ii are the same across English, mathematics and science. If a pupil is judged to be higher than P3ii in English, then separate descriptors (P4–P8) can be given in reading, writing, speaking or listening and an overall English descriptor is not expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      This also applies to mathematics, number, using and applying mathematics, and shape, space and measures. For science, a single judgement from P1i–P8 should be given.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a pupil is assessed as being between P4–P8 for English or mathematics, P scales should be used for the individual attainment targets. For example, if a pupil is working at P4 or above in English, individual P scales should be used for speaking and listening, reading, and writing, not an overall English P scale.

     <p>
      There may be exceptional circumstances where a pupil is judged to be at P1i–P3ii in English and / or mathematics but at P4–P8 in a particular element of the subject. In these cases you are able to use a combination of overall and attainment target P scales.

      Mixture of P scales and interim pre-key stage standards

     <p>
      Where a pupil is working between the interim pre-key stage standard and P scales, you should make a judgement to decide whether the interim pre-key stage standard can be appropriately applied for the subject.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the pupil is not working at the standard of the interim pre-key stage standards, the BLW code should be used along with P scales for as many components as applicable, and left blank for those that are not applicable.
