      The goal of any logistics operation is to move a product from supplier to customer – this path is called the supply chain, and it needs to keep moving in order for goods to arrive at the right place, at the right time. This apprenticeship trains you to play an important role in this, liaising with a range of people including suppliers, manufacturers, retailers and consumers.
