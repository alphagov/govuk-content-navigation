      Ofsted has launched far-reaching changes to the way it inspects early years provision, schools and further education and skills. These changes will come in to effect from September 2015 and include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the introduction of a common inspection framework for all early years settings on the Early Years Register, maintained schools and academies, non-association independent schools and further education and skills providers
      </li>
      <li>
       short inspections for maintained schools, academies and further education and skills providers that were judged good at their last full inspection. These short inspections will be conducted approximately every 3 years
      </li>
      <li>
       significant changes to Ofsted’s inspection workforce. From September 2015, Ofsted will contract directly with inspectors for maintained schools, academies, non-association independent schools and further education and skills inspections
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      From this page you can access the new common inspection framework and supporting handbooks. There is also additional information outlining the key changes including materials from Ofsted’s national launch conferences.
     </p>
     <p>
      The changes are a result of the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/better-inspection-for-all">
       consultation ‘Better inspection for all’ and subsequent response
