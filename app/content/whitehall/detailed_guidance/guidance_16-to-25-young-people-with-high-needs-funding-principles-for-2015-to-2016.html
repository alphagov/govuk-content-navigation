     <p>
      This guide is primarily for local authorities and institutions. It’s intended to support the commissioning discussions that both parties will have with each other over the coming months as student placements are agreed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The information in the guide will also be of use to anyone who has an interest in high needs funding. It describes how the high needs funding system will work for post-16 institutions for the academic year 2015 to 2016.
     </p>
     <h2 id="introduction">
      Introduction
     </h2>
     <p>
      Local authorities have lead responsibility for implementing the special educational needs and or disabilities (
      <abbr title="special educational needs and or disabilities">
       SEND
      </abbr>
      ) reforms in local areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, general further education (
      <abbr title="further education">
       FE
      </abbr>
      ) colleges, sixth-form colleges, non-maintained special schools (
      <abbr title="non-maintained special schools">
       NMSS
      </abbr>
      ), approved special post-16 institutions (SPIs) and 16 to 19 academies (including free schools) have taken on significant new legal duties. These include the duty to cooperate with the local authority on arrangements for children and young people with
      <abbr title="special educational needs and or disabilities">
       SEND
      </abbr>
      (with a reciprocal duty on the local authority) and to admit a young person if, following consultation with the institution, the institution is named in an Education Health and Care (
      <abbr title="Education Health and Care">
       EHC
      </abbr>
      ) plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Collaboration between local authorities and institutions to agree a pupil’s or student’s support package and timely agreement of funding, placements and contracting will lead to more efficient ways of working and better outcomes for young people and their parents and carers.

      Definition of a 16- to 25-year-old high needs student
     </h2>
     <p>
      For funding purposes, a high needs student is defined as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a young person aged 16 to 18 who requires additional support costing over £6,000
      </li>
      <li>
       any young person aged 19 to 25 subject to a Learning Difficulty Assessment (
       <abbr title="Learning Difficulty Assessment">
        LDA
       </abbr>
       ) or an
       <abbr title="Education Health and Care">
        EHC
       </abbr>
       plan who requires additional support costing over £6,000
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      In all instances, a high needs student’s placement must be commissioned by the local authority and include the top-up funding (element 3) to be paid to an institution. An agreement must be in place between the 2 parties to that effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the local authority does not agree a placement (even where an institution may have assessed a student as requiring additional support or a student has been offered a place by that institution) and top-up funding for a student is not agreed to, these students can’t be counted as high needs for funding purposes.

      From the academic year 2015 to 2016, the
      <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">
       DSG
      </abbr>
      cannot be used to fund places for or incur other expenditure (ie top-up funding) on 19- to 25-year-olds in special schools (maintained and non-maintained) and special academies. For more information, see regulation 14 and paragraph 18 of schedule 2 to the
      <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3352/contents/made" rel="external">
       School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2014
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      There will be an exception only for those 19-year-olds who are completing a secondary education course started before they were 18. This will reflect the current position, whereby students cannot remain at special schools beyond the age of 19 (subject to the same exception for those completing secondary education courses).
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools wishing to offer provision to students aged 19 to 25 may wish to consider setting up a legally and financially separate entity. They may then wish to apply for a direct contract and funding for places from Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      ) through their high needs students market entry process. This process ensures that any such new provision is tailored to the needs of persons aged 19 to 25 with

     <p>
      Local authorities should not use their high needs budget allocation from their
      <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">

      to fund students who are over the age of 19 and do not have an

      ) can only be used to support students who are in
      <abbr title="further education">

     </p>
     <p>
      Where a young person aged 19 (or over but under 25) arrives at college and, based on the institution’s assessment, is likely to need additional support costing over £6,000, the institution can request a statutory assessment for an
      <abbr title="Education Health and Care">
       EHC
      </abbr>
      plan from the young person’s local authority. In these cases, the local authority has up to 6 weeks to decide whether to conduct an assessment.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the decision to assess or actual assessment period is ongoing, the institution should enrol the learner as an adult learner funded by the
      <abbr title="Skills Funding Agency">
       SFA
      </abbr>
      . If the learner subsequently goes on to receive an
      <abbr title="Education Health and Care">
       EHC
      </abbr>
      plan then the institution should make a change to the individual learner record (
      <abbr title="individual learner record">

      A local authority must keep under review the ongoing need for an

      <abbr title="Education Health and Care">
       EHC
      </abbr>

     <p>
      The local authority must liaise with the
      <abbr title="Skills Funding Agency">
       SFA
      </abbr>
      before they commission a programme for a student that is likely continue past the academic year in which the student turns 25, as this means that the commissioning and funding will transfer to the

     <p>
      The funding system has two aspects which are
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       place funding known as elements 1 and 2 for post-16 institutions (except special schools and special academies)
      </li>
      <li>
       top-up funding (known as element 3 for post-16 institutions)
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Place funding cannot be reserved by a local authority for a specific pupil or student, or local authority area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Place funding includes the funding which pupils and students at an institution attract for their core education and basic programmes and funding to meet the first £6,000 of additional support costs. Place funding it is not intended to align exactly with the number of pupils or students in an institution at any given time, but instead provides a base level of funding for institutions and financial stability for institutions to help with stability of provision and planning.
     </p>
     <p>
      Top-up funding is that which is required over and above place funding, to enable a pupil or student with high needs to participate in education and learning.
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA

      makes an allocation to local authorities for high needs as part of the
      <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">

      These organisation types should therefore not seek funds from local authorities for any shortfall in element 1 in 2015 to 2016. A shortfall will be rectified in the lagged allocation for 2016 to 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      The cash value of element 1 paid to each institution changes each year and is an average for that institution based on historical data. Therefore variations in the value of element 1 between individual high needs students according to what programme they are studying are not relevant to the amount that a local authority will pay in top-up funding under element 3.
     </p>
     <p>
      For 2015 to 2016 local authorities should continue to use a national average figure of £5,000 as the assumed element 1 value for all post-16 high needs students, except for those students in special schools and special academies.
     </p>
     <h4 id="element-2">
      Element 2
     </h4>
     <p>
      Element 2 is the second component of place funding and provides £6,000 to help meet the additional support costs for high needs students.
     </p>
     <p>
      This element of place funding is not intended to meet the needs of students who need a lower level of support costing less than £6,000, who should be supported through an institution’s pot of disadvantage funding.

      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">

      </abbr>
      always confirms allocations of place funding in good time and well ahead of the beginning of the academic year to allow institutions enough time to plan and manage resources and provision. Therefore, allocations of place funding do not always reflect subsequent commissioning and placement decisions made by local authorities and the following principles apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>
        Element 2 places are not reserved for a specific student or local authority. Institutions are free to fill places in the order that local authorities agree and commission placements for individual students, and to decide how best to apportion their total allocated place funding across the actual number of commissioned places.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Where a local authority wants to commission further places at an institution that has filled all the places it has been funded for (irrespective of which local authority has filled them), agreement needs to be reached with the institution on the level of funding required. A local authority should not automatically be charged an extra £6,000 per head if it is agreed that the institution can provide the support package for additional students at marginal additional cost. This is of course less likely in the case of students with high needs whose support is often individualised and expensive because of the nature of their needs. In all cases local authorities and institutions will need to agree a mutually acceptable approach that represents best value and the local authority will need to fund this from its high needs budget.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Local authorities have the flexibility to agree small changes to the published 2015 to 2016 high needs place numbers allocated to maintained schools and maintained special schools. Such revisions, including the movement of funding between these maintained institutions, are to be managed and agreed directly with the institutions concerned by using the high needs allocations flexibly and within the terms of the sixth-form funding agreement with
        <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
         EFA
        </abbr>
        .
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        To ensure good planning and best use of funds, it’s important for local authorities working across sub-regions and regions to collaborate and share intelligence on available places.

      A local authority may reasonably expect an institution to explain why a certain level of additional top-up is appropriate for a particular place before entering into its own contract, but cannot seek to recover or reconcile funding for element 2 places which it perceives as being unused from the previous or current academic year and earmarked for the authority.

     </p>
     <p>
      Where an institution has or is considering enrolling a student that meets this criteria, the institution should, as always, hold discussions with LAs as they are the commissioners of high needs places. If a part-time place is agreed by the local authority, the institution should use place funding where available. If the institution has used all its allocated element 2 place funding then the local authority should fund the part-time costs from its high needs budget.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the agreed support costs for a part-time high needs student in that academic year are £6,000 or less, then the institution should not record the learner as a high needs student on the
      <abbr title="individual learner record">

      Top-up funding: element 3
     </h4>
     <p>
      Element 3, top-up funding, is the funding required over and above the place funding to enable a student with high needs to participate in education and learning. This is administered by the local authority in which the student is resident from their high needs budgets, in line with their commissioning of places for children and young people with high needs for whom they have responsibility.
     </p>
     <p>
      Top-up funding rates should mainly reflect the additional support costs in excess of £6,000 relating to individual pupils and students.
     </p>
     <p>
      Top-up funding can also reflect costs that relate to the facilities needed to support a student’s education and training needs either for individuals or on offer to all, and can take into account expected place occupancy levels and other factors.
