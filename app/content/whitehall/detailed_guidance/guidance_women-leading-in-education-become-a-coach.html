      Pledge to coach women teachers in schools
     </h2>
     <p>
      If you’re a leader and want to help more women to become leaders in education, pledge to coach. Coaching has the potential to transform the leadership journey of women teachers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Coaching has the power to increase confidence, unlock potential and build resilience. It is flexible, bespoke and specific to need.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is a great opportunity to help more women progress into leadership roles. Pledge to coach is one of the measures announced by government to support women in teaching.
     </p>
     <p>
      73.8% of all classroom teachers are female; only 62% of headteachers are female. This data comes from the School Workforce in England: November 2015 statistical first release.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our ambition is to have 1,000 pledges so that 1,000 women aspirant leaders are supported through coaching. We need you to volunteer your time, expertise and passion to make this happen.
     </p>
     <p>
      We’ll review your profile before adding it to the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/women-leading-in-education-coach-directory">
       directory
      </a>
      , which will be used by women teachers looking for a coach. They’ll be able to contact you directly to discuss and arrange coaching requirements. Your profile should take about 20 minutes to complete. You’ll need to sign up to the

      Principles of good practice
     </h2>
     <p>
      Good coaches listen and facilitate objectively, without solving people’s problems for them. The most important skill in coaching is asking questions within a coaching conversation. It is important that you have relevant competence or experience to support the coaching process. You should:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       provide a clear outline of the coaching you offer and the extent of your professional expertise
      </li>
      <li>
       explain the nature and limits of confidentiality surrounding the coaching you provide
      </li>
      <li>
       agree the number and length of sessions with participants to achieve their goals
      </li>
      <li>
       work with participants to review progress, achieve/refine goals and conclude coaching at the right time
      </li>
      <li>
       provide clear expectations about the review and exit process, so participants are able to conclude their coaching appropriately
      </li>
      <li>
       ensure participants are satisfied with their coaching by monitoring the effectiveness of the coaching process as well as the achievement of agreed outcomes
      </li>
      <li>
       believe in the potential for others to grow and develop
      </li>
      <li>
       focus on achieving positive action and outcomes (either long or short term)
      </li>
      <li>
       be self-aware, confident and have personal presence
      </li>
      <li>
       be competent at working with different attitudes, beliefs and behaviours
      </li>
