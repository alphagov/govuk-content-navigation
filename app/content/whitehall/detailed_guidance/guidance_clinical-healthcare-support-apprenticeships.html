      There are 2 types of apprenticeship.

     <h3 id="intermediate-level-apprenticeships">
      Intermediate level apprenticeships
     </h3>
     <p>
      You can train in roles like:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       clinical healthcare support worker
      </li>
      <li>
       healthcare assistant
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="advanced-level-apprenticeships">
      Advanced level apprenticeships
     </h3>
     <p>
      The job roles for advanced level apprentices are the same as for intermediate apprenticeships. However, apprentices would have additional responsibilities such as supervising junior teams members, taking physiological measurements and carrying out more complex clinical procedures (eg wound care).
