      How to get
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      funding for post-16 education and training
     </h2>
     <p>
      Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      ) directly funds colleges, providers, schools, academies and independent specialist providers for the provision of education and training to students aged 16 to 19 (and up to 24 for those with learning disability or learning difficulty).
     </p>
     <p>
      Every year we review the procedures for prospective providers of education to be recognised and receive funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are a number of ways to enter this market dependent on the type of institution proposed.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is a legislative requirement under the Education Act 2011 that all new schools must be academies. You can apply to open different types of academy including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       academies
      </li>
      <li>
       free schools
      </li>
      <li>
       university technical colleges (UTCs)
      </li>
      <li>
       studio schools
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Some of the processes for establishing these types of institution are subject to fixed application windows.

     <h3 id="gaps-in-provision">
      Gaps in provision
     </h3>
     <p>
      Under EU procurement law, we do not always have to tender for the delivery of education and training opportunities. However, when we do fund a new provider or new provision there is an expectation that processes and procedures are fair and  transparent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Therefore, we use a mix of local negotiation and tendering appropriate to the circumstances in each case.
     </p>
     <p>
      In support of local authorities’ statutory duty to secure provision in an area, we will consider their requests to fill a gap in provision. Where these gaps cannot be filled through negotiation with good existing providers they are put out to tender through open competition and advertised through the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/efa-e-bulletin">
       <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
        EFA
       </abbr>
       e-bulletin
      </a>
      and on
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contracts-finder">
       ‘Contracts Finder’
      </a>
      , the government’s site for advertising its contract opportunities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local authorities may submit a case regarding a gap in provision at any point in the year. Cases should be made using a standard template:
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="attachment-inline" id="attachment_1642827">
       <a href="/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/539635/EFA_Gaps_Template.docx">
        Market entry LA gaps application template
       </a>
       (
       <span class="type">
        MS Word Document
       </span>
       ,
       <span class="file-size">
        77.7KB
       </span>
       )
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      We will apply standard criteria to ensure that the gap is well evidenced prior to securing additional places.
     </p>
     <h3 id="replacement-provision">
      Replacement provision
     </h3>
     <p>
      We may seek to replace provision lost through a market failure or forced exit by government intervention or a voluntary exit created by a provider’s own business decision.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subject to circumstances we may negotiate with local providers about replacing that provision. Where replacement provision cannot be secured through an appropriate existing provider(s) it will normally be put out to tender through open competition and advertised through the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/efa-e-bulletin">
       <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
        EFA

       Contracts Finder
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the need to secure alternative provision for existing students is urgent,
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      may elect to make a single tender award in line with its internal scheme of delegation.
     </p>
     <h2 id="new-high-quality-provision">
      New high-quality provision

     <p>
      We want to ensure that opportunities for developing new outstanding provision are always available.
     </p>
     <p>
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      will fund new provision where it adds value and is a high quality addition to the existing offer for young people. To this end, we are open to discussions about new provision with commercial and charitable providers (CCPs) without an
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      contract that currently hold (or receive in the course of the year) an Ofsted rating of grade 1 outstanding for overall effectiveness.
     </p>
     <p>
      We will only support new provision as part of this process. We will not consider approaches that are seeking to move sub-contracted provision to a directly funded contract.

      Expanding a school or academy by adding a sixth-form

      A maintained school can apply to its local authority if it wishes to extend the age range of its school to add a sixth-form. For more information you can find guidance about
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-organisation-maintained-schools">
       changes to a school and expansions
      </a>
      on GOV.UK.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary of State retains responsibility for decisions to make significant changes to academies. If an academy wishes to extend its age range to add a sixth-form it should submit a business case using our

       online enquiry form
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to make a decision, the Secretary of State will need to know:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the rationale for the proposal, including the demand for the additional provision and the educational benefits to students
      </li>
      <li>
       the degree of support from the local authority, the local community and parents
      </li>
      <li>
       evidence of the school’s ability to deal with the change, specifically in terms of leadership and governance
      </li>
      <li>
       any proposed changes to the way the school is governed and suggested changes to admissions arrangements
      </li>
      <li>
       issues around the existing school site, including any plans for capital adaptations, additions, refurbishments and land transfers needed
      </li>
      <li>
       cost effectiveness in terms of capital and recurrent funding (the proposal should include some indicative costings and proposals for how costs might be met)

      Contract novation can only occur with the written agreement of the lead contractor. We must also be satisfied that the sub-contractor or new organisation has the capacity and facilities to deliver high quality provision in its own right.
