      If you’re not accredited to provide early years
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      training, you can work with an existing accredited provider. You must have a partnership agreement in place with your accredited provider which explains the roles and responsibilities of each partner.
     </p>
     <h2 id="training">
      Training
     </h2>
     <p>
      You’ll need to design your training programme to enable each of your trainees to meet the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-teachers-standards">
       Teachers’ Standards (Early Years)
      </a>
      . They’re designed for high quality work with the birth to 5 years age range. Your programme will include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the content they must cover
      </li>
      <li>
       how you structure and assess their performance
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Trainee teachers must be trained to teach across the early years foundation stage (from birth to 5 years old). They must also understand how early education links beyond age 5 and into key stages 1 and 2 in school.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your training programme will need to provide trainees with enough time in early years settings or schools to allow them to show they meet the standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      Assuming trainees are full time, this would mean:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       160 days (32 weeks) for a 4 year undergraduate programme
      </li>
      <li>
       120 days (24 weeks) for a 3 year undergraduate programme or graduate (university-based) route
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Placements should take place in at least 2 schools or early years settings and include at least 2 weeks in a school in key stage 1.
     </p>
     <p>
      For graduates on an employment-based route, the amount of time will be determined by their specific training programme.
     </p>
     <p>
      You shouldn’t recommend any trainee for the award of
      <abbr title="early years teacher status">
       EYTS
      </abbr>
      until they have met all the

      You must ensure candidates:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       have achieved GCSEs, grade C (or equivalent) in English, maths and a science subject
      </li>
      <li>
       hold a degree (Level 6) from a UK higher education institution or equivalent qualification (in the case of graduate routes)

      <li>
       have taken part in a rigorous selection process designed to assess their suitability to teach
      </li>

      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Qualifications in key and functional skills at level 2 are not equivalent to GCSEs in terms of content. You should look for additional evidence of knowledge and understanding for applicants with these skills certificates but without GCSEs at grade C or above in English and maths.
     </p>
     <p>
      Applicants with a GCSE grade C or above in English language meet the requirement.  You should look for further evidence of a breadth of achievement in English where applicants have achieved a GCSE grade C or above in English literature.
