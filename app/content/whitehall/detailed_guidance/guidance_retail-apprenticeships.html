      As a retail apprentice, your role will depend on your employer. You could be assisting customers on the sales floor of a high street store or handling their purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alternatively, you could be working in a specialist department and become a product expert, able to help with specific queries.
     </p>
     <p>
      An artistic flare could point you in the direction of visual merchandising, helping to create window and in-store displays. Or you could work behind the scenes in stock handling; ensuring products are received in the correct quantities and appropriately stored.
     </p>
     <p>
      With a young workforce, the UK’s retail sector is vibrant and offers many opportunities for early career progression.
