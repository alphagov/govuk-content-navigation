       This guidance will be updated for the 2017 test cycle in March.

     <h2 id="what-is-special-consideration">
      What is special consideration?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Special consideration applies when a pupil’s performance in the key stage 2 tests has been affected by extremely distressing circumstances at the time of the tests (test week and the weeks immediately prior to test week). It also applies where an incident which may have occurred in the months before the tests is still having an impact on the pupil demonstrating their potential.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under these circumstances, teachers can apply for this to be taken into consideration via the ‘Access arrangements’ section of
      <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">
       NCA tools
      </a>
      , from Friday 13 May.
     </p>
     <div class="call-to-action">
      <p>
       Special consideration will not be awarded for pupils who were not fit to sit the tests as a result of illness or other circumstances that have occurred at the time of the tests.
      </p>
     </div>
     <h2 id="eligible-circumstances-for-special-consideration">
      Eligible circumstances for special consideration
     </h2>
     <p>
      Special consideration may be granted under the following circumstances if they occurred at the time of the tests:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       on-going proceedings, such as the pupil having to appear in court
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupil experiences a serious and disruptive domestic crisis
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupil is affected by a severe disease, asthmatic attack or flare-up of severe congenital conditions, such as epilepsy or diabetes
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupil experiences a severe physical assault or trauma
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Or in the 6 months before the tests:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the diagnosis of a terminal illness of the pupil or close family member
      </li>
      <li>
       a significant incapacitating illness of the pupil or close family member
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupil undergoes major surgery
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupil is involved in a severe car accident
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupil suffers a severe or permanent bodily injury
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If the pupil suffers the death of a close family member or friend in the 12 months before the tests, special consideration may also be considered.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any other major unpredicted disruption must be specified in your application. You will need to provide the dates of when the incident took place, or circumstances began, as part of your application.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a whole cohort of pupils has been affected by an incident, only those pupils most closely involved will usually be eligible. Applications for special consideration should be submitted separately for each pupil.
     </p>
     <h2 id="circumstances-not-eligible-for-special-consideration">
      Circumstances not eligible for special consideration
     </h2>
     <p>
      Special consideration is not applicable when the pupil:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       is ill on the day and not fit state to sit the test. In these circumstances schools should consider using a timetable variation to administer the test at a more appropriate time
      </li>
      <li>
       has a sudden, temporary illness such as vomiting – in these circumstances the school should consider allowing the pupil a rest break or make a timetable application or notification to administer the test either later the same day or on a different day (as long as the test was not started)
      </li>
      <li>
       has had a minor injury, the effects of which could be dealt with by the school making an alternative arrangement, such as allowing rests breaks and/or providing a scribe
      </li>
      <li>
       has a long-term illness, which has prevented the pupil covering the whole of the curriculum or affected the pupil’s preparation for the tests
      </li>
      <li>
       has been educated at home or excluded from school and needs time to adjust to the national curriculum
      </li>
      <li>
       has recently arrived from a different education system and needs time to adjust to the national curriculum
      </li>
      <li>
       has a sensory or physical disability or condition which prevents them from accessing the tests, even with access arrangements or modified test materials
      </li>
      <li>
       is working below the standard of the tests
      </li>
      <li>
       where long-term circumstances may have affected the pupil from reaching the standard of the tests
      </li>
      <li>
       has experienced the death of a close family member, or close friend, more than 12 months before the tests, unless there are ongoing proceedings such as an inquest or court case at the time of the tests
      </li>
      <li>
       is affected by the consequences of committing a crime
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Special consideration will not be granted due to circumstances which have affected the preparation and administration of a test, for example:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a disturbance during the test such as a fire alarm or disruptive behaviour
      </li>
      <li>
       the incorrect administration of the test, such as incorrect allocation of time, or errors made by the school when modifying or photocopying test scripts
      </li>
      <li>
       a failure to implement previously agreed access arrangements
      </li>
      <li>
       a failure to apply for access arrangements on time
      </li>
      <li>
       late receipt of test materials or incorrectly collated test papers
      </li>
      <li>
       difficulties during the school year that might have affected preparations for the tests, such as disturbances through building work or shortages of staff
      </li>
     </ul>
