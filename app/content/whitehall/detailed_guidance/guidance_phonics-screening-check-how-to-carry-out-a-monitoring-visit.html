        <p>
         Local authorities (
         <abbr title="local authorities">
          LAs
         </abbr>
         ) have a statutory responsibility to monitor the administration of the phonics screening check. This helps to ensure that the security and confidentiality of the check materials are maintained and that the assessments are administered correctly and consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
         To carry out a visit correctly, you need to be familiar with this guidance as well as the
         <a href="https://www-origin.staging.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/collections/phonics-screening-check-administration">
          check administration guidance
         </a>
         for schools.
        </p>
        <p>
         Your monitoring visits co-ordinator will give you specific information before each visit. Make sure you take:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          copies of the phonics screening check monitoring visit form
         </li>
         <li>
          information to show which check materials the school has received
         </li>
         <li>
          details of the number of pupils being assessed at the school including any year 2 pupils who are expected to take the check
         </li>
         <li>
          copies of the 2016 check materials
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         You must also take photo identification with you to present on arrival at a school. This can be a passport, driving license or official work pass.

        <p id="before">
         Depending on when your visit takes place you will need to observe certain aspects of phonics screening check administration to make sure the school is following our published guidance correctly. Use the monitoring visits form to record what you see. At the end of the visit you will need to meet with the headteacher, or delegated member of staff, to discuss your findings.
        </p>
        <h3 id="visits-before-the-check-week">
         Visits before the check week
        </h3>
        <p>
         These monitoring visits take place during the week commencing 6 June. You should use these visits to make sure that the phonics screening check materials are unopened and stored securely, and that the school has received the correct number of packs. You can also discuss other elements of the proposed administration, such as the room(s) where the check will take place.
        </p>
        <h4 id="check-materials">
         Check materials
        </h4>
        <p>
         Your monitoring visits co-ordinator will give you details of the number of phonics screening check packs delivered to the school. Ask the headteacher for annotated copies of their delivery note(s) and details of the number of check packs that were actually delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ensure that all of the phonics screening check materials are sealed and stored securely.

        <h4 id="damaged-check-packs">
         Damaged check packs
        </h4>
        <p>
         If a school has received damaged check packs, advise them, if they have not already done so, to contact immediately the
         <a href="#help">
          national curriculum assessments helpline
         </a>
         . The school may be asked to send us a photograph of the damaged packages.

        <h4 id="early-opening-of-materials">
         Early opening of materials
        </h4>
        <p>
         If you are carrying out a monitoring visit during the week commencing 6 June, the phonics screening check materials should not have been opened. If teachers need to make adjustments to the check so that pupils can access it, these should be made during the check period, from Monday 13 June. There are no exceptions.
        </p>
        <h4 id="who-should-administer-the-phonics-screening-check">
         Who should administer the phonics screening check
        </h4>
        <p>
         You should speak to the headteacher, or the teacher responsible for the administration of the phonics screening check, to ensure that an appropriate teacher will be administering it and that they fully understand the administration arrangements, including scoring.
        </p>
        <p id="during">
         The phonics screening check must be administered on a one-to-one basis by a teacher who is known to the pupil. It must not be administered by a teaching assistant, including higher level teaching assistants, because the role requires a teacher’s professional judgement about which responses are correct. The teacher must not be a relative or carer of the pupil taking the check.
        </p>
        <h3 id="visits-during-the-phonics-screening-check-week">
         Visits during the phonics screening check week
        </h3>
        <p>
         These visits take place during the phonics screening check week, Monday 13 June to Friday 17 June.  You should read your copy of the 2016 check materials before the visit so that you are familiar with the words pupils will be asked to decode. This will help you to judge whether any pupils are given inappropriate assistance. Any printed versions of these materials must be kept secure until Friday 24 June.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should arrive at the school in time to observe the complete phonics screening check administration process. This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          opening the check packs (if you arrive in time to observe the first check)
         </li>
         <li>
          administering the check(s)
         </li>
         <li>
          storing the check materials and answer sheets securely
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         You should also establish that:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          the room for the phonics screening check is suitable
         </li>
         <li>
          wall displays are covered up or, if uncovered, they don’t offer any assistance or distraction to pupils
         </li>
         <li>
          appropriate teachers will be administering the check
         </li>
         <li>
          the school has made appropriate preparations for submission of data
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         You should carry out the checks relating to visits

        <h4 id="pupil-observation">
         Pupil observation
        </h4>
        <p>
         You should aim to observe between 2 and 5 checks (depending on the size of the cohort).
        </p>
        <p>
         Confirm with the headteacher, or teacher responsible for the administration of the phonics screening check, whether any pupils will be uncomfortable being observed. It is important that pupils are not put off by the presence of a visitor. If a pupil is likely to be distracted, you should observe another pupil instead.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should also agree with the headteacher and / or the teacher administering the phonics screening check whether your presence should be explained to the pupil you are going to observe.
        </p>
        <h4 id="what-to-do-when-observing-the-phonics-screening-check">
         What to do when observing the phonics screening check
        </h4>
        <p>
         You should only enter the room before a pupil starts the phonics screening check. This is so that your monitoring activity doesn’t disturb the pupil or interrupt administration of the check. The teacher can also explain your presence to the pupil, if appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         When you observe the phonics screening check ensure that:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          it is introduced to the pupil appropriately
         </li>
         <li>
          no inappropriate assistance is given
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         You are not expected to score any phonics screening checks in parallel with the teacher administering the check. You might consider discussing the scoring decisions with the teacher, but you should not overrule the teacher’s judgement on a pupil’s responses to the check.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you observe what you consider to be misconceptions of phonics and / or the scoring of the check, you should discuss this with the teacher after the check has been administered. (For example, a visitor may think that the teacher has not realised that an alternative pronunciation of a grapheme should be scored correctly.) You would not need to report this to us.
        </p>
        <p>
         After the check has been completed, discuss the administration of the check with the teacher.

         You should leave a copy of the monitoring visit form, and any delivery notes you have annotated, with the headteacher or delegated member of staff. You must not add any additional detail or make changes to the monitoring visit form after this point.
