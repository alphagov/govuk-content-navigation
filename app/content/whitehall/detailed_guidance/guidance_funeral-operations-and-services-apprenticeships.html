      Demands in this sector are changing with the times and with the advent of the internet and other technological advancements, funeral care has had to adapt to client requests.
     </p>
     <p>
      Due to the nature of the work, dealing with last wishes etc, it is seen as very important that employees gain the appropriate qualifications.
     </p>
     <p>
      Because of the quite specialist qualifications that are required, an apprenticeship allows you to learn from the experts and get your knowledge up to scratch quickly.
