        <p>
         Markers must have qualified teacher status and teaching experience in the relevant subject and / or key stage. They need to work with speed and accuracy, be organised, have confidence in their subject knowledge and have an open-minded approach to children’s work.
        </p>
        <p>
         Markers can be:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          currently teaching
         </li>
         <li>
          recently retired from teaching
         </li>
         <li>
          a former teacher now working in another field
         </li>
         <li>
          on maternity/paternity leave or taking a career break from teaching.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

         The science sampling tests take place every other year. Recruitment for 2016 has now closed.

        <p>
         Before you’re approved to mark the tests you’ll receive training and support on the marking process and mark scheme. You must also demonstrate you can apply the mark scheme accurately and consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
         Training includes written guidance, face-to-face training sessions and ongoing support from a supervisor.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mark scheme training meeting takes place in May, shortly after children sit the test. It ensures you understand the marking procedures and introduces you to the support network available throughout the marking process.
        </p>
        <p>
         You will demonstrate your ability to mark accurately and consistently by marking a set of practice scripts and then at least one set of standardisation scripts. The accuracy of your marking will be checked against an agreed standard. If you are approved your marking accuracy will be assessed throughout the marking period to check you are still marking to the agreed standard.
        </p>
        <p>
         If successful, you’ll start marking test scripts shortly after the tests take place in May. You will usually complete your marking within 3 or 4 weeks.
