      Retail is a sector which rewards dedication and hard work with quick career progression.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is especially the case with younger people, with individuals in their late teens and early twenties often finding themselves in positions such as section or team leader.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is a fantastic apprenticeship in terms of career prospects. Around 1.4 million new positions are expected to open up in retail in the next 3 years. To keep up with this demand, around 400,000 new supervisory and leadership employees are needed every year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The problem facing many retailers is trouble finding staff with the right level of skill and ability to manage a team or store, and effectively drive up sales.
