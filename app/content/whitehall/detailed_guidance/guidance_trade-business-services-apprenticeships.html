      This work is strictly in a business-to-business environment, normally in bulk, and does not really involve members of the public. However, you could be dealing with small business owners and you cannot expect everyone to have a full understanding of products or services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Because of the nature of the trade, much of the business conducted is over the phone and internet.

      The trade business services industry has traditionally recruited employees with little or no relevant experience.
     </p>
     <p>
      This intermediate apprenticeship is a great starting point for anyone wanting to get into the sector as it provides a structured training route.
     </p>
     <p>
      You will have to be able to keep up to changes in the law and in business practices and be approachable with great service skills.
