       Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
       Academy trusts are required by their funding agreements to submit financial returns to the Education Funding Agency (
       <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
        EFA
       </abbr>
       ). This guide explains how to submit these returns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The financial accountability and assurance framework is set out in the
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">
        Academies Financial Handbook
       </a>
       and the
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-financial-assurance">
        detailed guide to academies financial assurance

       .

        Academy trust accounting officers are required to submit to
        <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
         EFA

        an

        by 31 January.
       </p>
      </div>
      <p>
       The accounts return is used for the
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/academies-sector-annual-report-and-accounts">
        academies sector annual report and accounts (SARA)
       </a>
       , which consolidates academy trust accounts for the year ending 31 August each year rather than as part of
       <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
        EFA
       </abbr>
       ’s and DfE’s annual accounts, which are based on year ending 31 March each year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The accounts return also helps DfE to produce benchmarking data that is comparable with maintained schools.
To help trusts prepare their accounts return,
       <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
        EFA
       </abbr>
       publishes an Excel template. This follows the same structure as the online return and may assist trusts with calculating and verifying their figures before they are entered into the online return.
      </p>
      <p>
       Academy trusts need to commission from their external auditors an assurance report on the preparation of the accounts return. The auditor’s report is the final step of the online form submission process.
      </p>
      <p>
       All trusts preparing financial statements as at 31 August 2016 and/or with open academies at 31 August 2016 should complete the accounts return.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deloitte carries out the validation of financial returns on
       <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
        EFA
       </abbr>
       ’s behalf, and may need to email your academy trust with queries about the data you supplied.
       <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
        EFA
       </abbr>
       will publish information about the validation tests, thresholds and standard questions Deloitte use in the guidance for the accounts return.
      </p>
      <p>
       The accounts return is separate to the requirement for academy trusts to produce audited financial statements. This requirement is set out in the
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-accounts-direction">
        Academies Accounts Direction
       </a>

       Academy trusts that open on or after 1 April each financial year and new academies joining an existing multi-academy trust on or after 1 April are required to submit their budget forecast return 6 weeks after receiving their final funding letter or by 31 July of the same year, depending which is later.

       A multi-academy trust (MAT) preparing aggregated financial statements comprising more than one academy must submit a consolidated budget forecast return aggregating the budgets of each of its academies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a new academy joins the MAT on or after the 31 July deadline, a separate return for that academy is required.
