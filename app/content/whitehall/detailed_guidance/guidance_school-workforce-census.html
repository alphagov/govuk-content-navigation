      The school workforce census is a statutory data collection that takes place each autumn. You must complete statutory censuses by law unless there’s a good reason not to.
     </p>
     <p>
      The census collects data on all teaching and support staff in regular employment, including those working for:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       local authorities on central contracts
      </li>
      <li>
       local-authority-maintained schools
      </li>
      <li>
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/academies">
        academies

       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/free-schools">
        free schools
       </a>
       , including:
       <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
         university technical colleges
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       pupil referral units (local authority establishments that provide education for children who can’t attend a mainstream school)
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Local authorities are responsible for:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       co-ordinating and approving the submission of census data from all their maintained schools
      </li>
      <li>
       submitting data for centrally employed school staff
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Academies are responsible for submitting and approving their own census data.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local authorities, local-authority-maintained schools and academies should issue
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-protection-and-privacy-privacy-notices">
       privacy notices
