      This is about providing young people with challenges and new experiences - allowing them to be creative, active and have fun.

     <p>
      Every young person has a unique situation so you could be doing all sorts, such as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       offering counselling and support
      </li>
      <li>
       developing projects that tackle issues
      </li>
      <li>
       organising activities like sports and drama
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      You’ll need to come up with creative ways to reach young people and be able to build relationships with them. There’s an administrative side to youth work too. You might:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       help manage volunteers or part-time staff
      </li>
      <li>
       help apply for grants
      </li>
      <li>
       keep records of your work
      </li>
      <li>
       network with other professionals including social workers, teachers and probation officers
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      At the end of your apprenticeship you’ll be a youth support worker - in a good position to take the next step in your career as a youth worker, with qualifications that most employers will support you in doing on a part-time basis.
