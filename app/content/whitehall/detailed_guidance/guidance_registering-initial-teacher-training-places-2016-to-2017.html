     <p>
      This guidance is for School Direct lead schools, school-centred initial teacher training (SCITTs) providers and higher education institutions (HEIs) as they plan to recruit trainees.
     </p>
     <p>
      We’re changing our approach for 1 year. Previously training places have significantly exceeded the number we’ve been able to allocate. Schools, SCITTs and HEIs have turned away good potential trainees once all of their allocated places have been filled.  We’ll monitor recruitment to 2016 to 2017 courses to inform the approach for 2017 to 2018.
     </p>
     <p>
      This approach only applies to postgraduate courses starting in the 2016 to 2017 academic year. It includes all subjects listed under the
      <a href="#list-of-designated-itt-subjects">
       list of designated
       <abbr title="initial teacher training">
        ITT
       </abbr>
       subjects
      </a>
      . We reserve the right to  modify or amend the approach we take to the registration of courses or allocation of places for future years.
     </p>
     <p>
      We’ll continue to
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-allocation-of-undergraduate-initial-teacher-training-itt-places">
       allocate places to undergraduate courses for the 2016 to 2017 academic year

      The registration window for 2016 to 2017 is closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The registration period opened on Tuesday 23 June. Lead schools and
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      providers had until 6pm on Friday 10 July 2015 to submit and, where appropriate, ratify course information. Failure to do this may have resulted in approval for recruitment being withheld.
     </p>
     <p>
      For School Direct, all courses must have been registered and ratified by the partner provider before the deadline. It is the responsibility of the lead school to ensure that this happened.

     </h3>
     <p>
      We’ll only approve School Direct courses where the identified lead school is one of the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       an academy  (including free schools)
      </li>
      <li>
       an independent school designated as a teaching school (an independent school can only act as a lead school if it is also a designated teaching school. Where this is the case, the trainees recruited should benefit from a partnership that includes maintained schools and/or academies. By maintained schools and/or academies, we mean: an academy; a free school; a maintained school; a pupil referral unit; a sixth form college; a special school)
      </li>
      <li>
       a maintained school
      </li>
      <li>
       a multi-academy trust (if a multi-academy trust is acting as a lead school we would not expect a member of that multi-academy trust to act as a lead school in their own right)
      </li>
      <li>
       a pupil referral unit (
       <abbr title="pupil referral unit">
        PRU
       </abbr>
       )
      </li>
      <li>
       a sixth-form college
      </li>
      <li>
       a maintained special school
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="ofsted-grade-of-the-lead-school">
      Ofsted grade of the lead school
     </h3>
     <p>
      We’ll only approve recruitment to School Direct courses where the identified lead school is graded good or outstanding for overall effectiveness by Ofsted in their most recent section 5 inspection.
     </p>
     <p>
      We’ll use the latest available inspection grades as published by Ofsted to determine eligibility. We’ll use the last available Ofsted grade of predecessor schools to determine the eligibility of recent academy convertors. Uninspected maintained schools and academies will be exempt from this criterion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools graded requires improvement or inadequate by Ofsted are still able to offer trainee placements and contribute to the planning and provision of School Direct courses within a school partnership. We’ll not apply penalties to a lead school, or disadvantage it in any other way, on the basis that it has chosen to work with schools in these categories.
     </p>
     <p>
      We strongly encourage lead schools to consider the range of school placements they offer to provide a broad mix of experiences for trainees. As part of this it is appropriate to evaluate how trainees can contribute to improvement in schools graded requires improvement or inadequate and, in turn, how they might benefit from experience of working within those schools.
     </p>
     <h3 id="ofsted-grade-of-the-itt-provider">

       ITT

     </h3>
     <p>
      We’ll only approve School Direct courses where the partner
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      provider is graded good or outstanding for overall effectiveness by Ofsted in the relevant phase of provision.
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, we’ll only approve provider-led courses where the
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      provider is graded good or outstanding for overall effectiveness in the relevant phase of provision.
     </p>
     <p>
      Similar to schools, we’ll use the latest published inspection grades when applying this criterion. Uninspected SCITTs will be exempt from this criterion. Where necessary, we’ll work with lead schools directly to resolve any issues if their partner provider receives an inadequate or requires improvement inspection outcome after the deadline for registration.
     </p>
     <h3 id="school-partnership-size">
      School partnership size
     </h3>
     <p>
      We’ll consider the size of the school partnerships identified by lead schools before approving recruitment to School Direct courses. Larger school partnerships provide better economies of scale for the planning, recruitment to, and provision of courses. As a result, we will only approve courses registered by a lead school with 4 or more partner schools, that is, where there are at least 5 schools in total in the partnership. We expect to increase the minimum school partnership size in future years.
     </p>
     <p>
      We’ll apply an exception to this rule where at least 3 members (the lead school plus partner schools) of the partnership are special schools.

     <p>
      Lead schools must identify a partner
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">

      provider for each School Direct course that they register. The
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">

      For the 2016 to 2017 academic year we’ll use a national estimate of the number of trainees required to meet the needs of the school system and we will manage recruitment at a national level.

     <p>
      Primary mathematics specialist courses are designed for trainees who want to focus solely on teaching mathematics in primary schools. Only those institutions that have been specifically accredited to offer this type of training course, or lead schools working with those providers, may recruit to such courses in 2016 to 2017.
     </p>

      The list of designated
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      providers for primary mathematics specialist courses is as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Bishop Grosseteste University College, Brook Learning Trust, Edge Hill University, UCL Institute of Education, University of Birmingham, University of East London, University of Greenwich, University of Leicester, University of Northampton, University of Reading, University of Roehampton, University of Wolverhampton, University of Worcester.
     </p>
     <p>
      We want to encourage other lead schools and
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      providers to identify or develop courses that train generalist primary teachers with a substantial mathematics element included alongside other areas of the curriculum. Teachers trained on these courses will not have the same exclusive focus on mathematics as a specialist but will have a robust grounding in the subject as part of their training. In particular, they will be capable of leading on mathematics in their school. Courses of this nature should be identified in the registration process as Primary – General (with mathematics).

      Primary physical education (PE)
