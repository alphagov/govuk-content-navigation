      As an intermediate level apprentice you could be working in a paper mill or a recovery plant making paper or corrugated board and tissue from wood pulp and recycled materials. On this apprenticeship you’ll learn:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       how to operate papermaking equipment
      </li>
      <li>
       basic testing and sampling
      </li>
      <li>
       packaging
      </li>
      <li>
       some finishing operations
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The advanced apprenticeship has 2 routes of specialisation:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       process engineering - operating more complex machinery and improving workflow
      </li>
      <li>
       process operations - leading a specific part of the process, possibly in the role of a team leader.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      You might also learn some engineering skills and carry out maintenance on machines, or learn how to effectively respond to any problems that may come up - and keep production processes going.
