      The Department for Education’s (

      )
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-efficiency-in-the-schools-system">
       review of efficiency in the school system
      </a>
      in 2013 set out to discover what the best schools do to make the most of their money and how to apply what they do to the sector as a whole. The review recognised financial benchmarking as a key tool in the drive for greater efficiency in schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      Benchmarking provides information to help schools consider how they use their resources. It aims to encourage school leaders to make informed financial decisions. It can also prompt school leaders to seek information and advice from similar schools.

      The examples and comparisons in the report card aim to help. They do not provide a measure of school efficiency. There may be good reasons why what a school spends in a particular area is greater than that of a similar school. However, benchmarking may lead schools to consider some areas where they are able to improve their efficiency.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can benchmark your school against any schools you like by using the schools financial benchmarking websites (links below). Schools may also find it useful to contact comparator schools and share best practice.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you are a school governor or academy trustee, please ask your school for a copy of its benchmarking report card.
     </p>
     <p>
      If your school has not received a benchmarking report card,

     </p>
     <p>
      You can use online benchmarking tools to prepare reports that compare your school’s income and expenditure profile with that of similar schools. You can use a range of factors such as size, type, percentage of
