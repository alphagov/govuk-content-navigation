      Introduction
     </h2>
     <p>
      For most academies, the 2015 autumn census return forms the basis for calculating pupil led funding for the 2016 to 2017 academic year. In some cases we use an estimate of pupil numbers if their funding agreement includes a clause to this effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      The types of academies funded on estimates include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       older academies with the funding agreement clause
      </li>
      <li>
       brand new institutions with no previous school
      </li>
      <li>
       growing schools that are still adding year groups
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The funding agreement clause may be conditional, and an academy’s allocation is funded on estimates until certain conditions are met. This is usually until all year groups are present, or where occupancy is more than 90% of total capacity. Once these conditions are met, the autumn census becomes the basis for future funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Special and alternative provision academies are not funded on estimates as the number of high needs places forms the basis of their general annual grant.  More information on how high needs places are funded is available in the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2016-to-2017">

      The estimate of pupil numbers is central to the calculation of an academy’s budget and we work with institutions to ensure this estimate is as accurate as possible. To help with the development of the estimate, the
      <abbr title="revenue funding data collection">
       RFDC
      </abbr>
      form includes trend information for the school. It provides, where available, the last five years estimated pupil numbers, the autumn census figures for the same year, the difference between the two, and any funding adjustments arising from the pupil number adjustment (
      <abbr title="pupil number adjustment">
       PNA
      </abbr>
      ) exercise.
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">

      </abbr>
      review the pupil number estimates to ensure they are reasonable, and that evidence supports any increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an academy in scope for the
      <abbr title="revenue funding data collection">
       RFDC
      </abbr>
      does not submit their pupil estimates,
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      will use the census data to calculate their funding - if they are a growing school that is still adding year groups - this can result in a funding shortfall.

     </h2>
     <p>
      Where we initially fund academies based on estimated pupil numbers, we include them in the annual pupil number adjustment (
      <abbr title="pupil number adjustment">
       PNA
      </abbr>
      ) exercise during the academic year. The exercise determines if adjustments are required to bring initial funding allocations into line with the actual pupil numbers that schools record in the autumn (October) school census.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some estimate-funded academies have funding agreements with a
      <abbr title="pupil number adjustment">
       PNA
      </abbr>
      threshold, where no adjustment will occur if actual pupil numbers vary by more or less than a specified percentage. If an academy’s estimate of pupil numbers is outside the threshold, or no threshold applies, we adjust funding through the
      <abbr title="pupil number adjustment">
       PNA
      </abbr>
      process. This results in either an increase or decrease in funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      We use an academy’s estimated pupil numbers and the funding they receive to produce a per-pupil funding rate for the academic year. We multiply the difference in actual pupil numbers, taking account of any threshold, by the per-pupil rate, to determine the required adjustment. As in previous years, we calculate separate rates and adjustments for the pre-16 school budget share, post-16 funding, and education services grant (
