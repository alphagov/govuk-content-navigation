      The NPQSL final assessment is competency based, testing the main competencies that are required for successful senior leadership.
     </p>
     <p>
      For participants who began before February 2014, the final assessment process includes 2 tasks (Closing the Gap, and Leading a School Improvement Priority). For this, you’ll be expected to use your practical experience, research and relevant school, local and national data to inform your leadership decision making. You’ll also be expected to apply your learning from the essential and elective modules you’ve completed and use your knowledge and expertise in relevant national policy priorities.
     </p>

      For participants beginning the qualification in February 2014 or later, the final assessment process has 1 assessed task. You’ll be expected to lead, for an extended period, a school improvement priority in your school. This needs to be achievable within a 12 month period and must produce positive impact and sustainable change.
