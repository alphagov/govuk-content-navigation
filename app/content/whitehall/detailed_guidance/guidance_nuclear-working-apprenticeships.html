      The government has outlined plans to build more nuclear power stations. Once a nuclear power station reaches the end of its working life it must be safely shut down and decommissioned.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the advent of ‘new build’ for a fleet of modern nuclear power stations, as well as existing operations and decommissioning, there are a number of opportunities across the sector
     </p>
     <p>
      A decommissioning operative would be involved in the safe decommissioning of plant and equipment on a licensed nuclear site. A radiation monitor would play a main role in the safe monitoring of personnel and work environments.
