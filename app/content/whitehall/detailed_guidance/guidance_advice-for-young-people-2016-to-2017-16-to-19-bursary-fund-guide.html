      Introduction
     </h2>
     <p>
      The 16 to 19 Bursary Fund is money the government has given to local authorities, schools, colleges and other education and training providers (education institutions) to give to students who need financial help to stay in education.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are 2 types of 16 to 19 bursaries:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a vulnerable bursary of up to £1,200 a year for young people in one of the defined vulnerable groups
      </li>
      <li>
       discretionary bursaries that institutions award to meet individual needs. For example, for transport, meals, books and equipment
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Your education institution is responsible for managing both types of bursary.
     </p>
     <h2 id="vulnerable-bursary">
      Vulnerable bursary
     </h2>
     <p>
      If you are in one of the groups below, you can apply for a vulnerable bursary:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       in care
      </li>
      <li>
       care leaver
      </li>
      <li>
       getting
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/income-support">
        Income Support
       </a>
       or
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/simplifying-the-welfare-system-and-making-sure-work-pays/supporting-pages/introducing-universal-credit">
        Universal Credit
       </a>
       in place of Income Support in your own name
      </li>
      <li>
       getting
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance">
        Employment Support Allowance
       </a>
       (or Universal Credit in place of ESA) and Disability Living Allowance or
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pip">

     </ul>
     <h3 id="how-much-will-i-get-paid-if-im-eligible">
      How much will I get paid if I’m eligible?
     </h3>
     <p>
      You could get up to £1,200 if you study full time for a minimum of 30 weeks. If your course is only for a few hours a week or less than 30 weeks, you will probably get less.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you don’t have costs, for example you’re a residential student who doesn’t travel, and all your meals and equipment are provided, you could get less than £1,200 or nothing at all. If this is the case your institution must say why.
     </p>
     <h3 id="proof-youre-eligible-for-a-vulnerable-bursary">
      Proof you’re eligible for a vulnerable bursary
     </h3>
     <p>
      Your institution will need proof you’re eligible. This could be:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a letter from your local authority showing you’re in care or a care leaver
      </li>
      <li>
       a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions showing the benefits you get
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Your institution will tell you what you need.
     </p>
     <h3 id="benefits-that-qualify-for-a-vulnerable-bursary">
      Benefits that qualify for a vulnerable bursary
     </h3>
     <p>
      Benefits must be in your own name to get a vulnerable bursary.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you don’t get them in your name, you won’t get a vulnerable bursary. Instead you may be able to apply for a discretionary bursary from your education institution.
     </p>
     <h3 id="young-carer">
      Young carer
     </h3>
     <p>
      As a young carer you won’t get a vulnerable bursary, unless you fall into one of the other defined vulnerable groups.
     </p>
     <div class="call-to-action">
      <p>
       However, you can apply for help for a discretionary bursary from your education institution. Your institution should ensure the information you give them is used confidentially so you can talk to them about your caring responsibilities when you’re applying for help.
      </p>
     </div>
     <h3 id="young-parent">
      Young parent
     </h3>
     <p>
      If you’re a young parent getting Income Support or Universal Credit in your own name you may get a vulnerable bursary. If you don’t get a vulnerable bursary, you may be able to apply for a discretionary bursary from your education institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      You might also get help with childcare costs through
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/care-to-learn">
       Care to Learn
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <h2 id="discretionary-bursary">
      Discretionary bursary
     </h2>
     <p>
      If you don’t fall into one of the vulnerable groups, but you need financial help to stay in education, you can apply for a discretionary bursary from your education institution. You must be between 16 and 19 years old and in full or part time further education or training.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your education institution is responsible for setting the eligibility criteria. Examples of what it could be based on are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       your family’s income
      </li>
      <li>
       if your parents get benefits
      </li>
      <li>
       if you currently receive free school meals or have had them in the past
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Institutions set eligibility criteria for the bursary because funds have to be targeted at students who need the most help to stay in education.
     </p>
     <p>
      How much you get is up to your institution. They decide who gets a bursary, how much, when it’s paid and can say what it should be spent on.
     </p>
     <h3 id="familys-finances">
      Family’s finances
     </h3>
     <p>
      If you apply, your institution may ask for evidence of your family’s household income. Examples include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions showing receipt of benefits
      </li>
      <li>
       a P60
      </li>
      <li>
       a Tax Credit Award Notice
      </li>
      <li>
       evidence of your family’s annual income
      </li>
      <li>
       3 months’ worth of payslips or bank account statements
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Your institution will let you know what you need to show them.
     </p>
     <h3 id="impact-on-dwp-benefits">
      Impact on DWP benefits
     </h3>
     <p>
      Bursary fund payments don’t affect your right to Department of Works and Pensions income-related benefits. They are paid directly to students as well as other means tested benefits and don’t affect them.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, if you’re getting Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments and Employment Support Allowance or Universal Credit, your parents can’t get certain benefits for you like child benefit.
     </p>
     <h3 id="help-to-pay-for-one-off-things">
      Help to pay for one-off things
     </h3>
     <p>
      Some institutions offer one-off payments for things like educational trips or to attend university interviews. This might be in addition to help with longer-term costs for things like bus fares.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ask your student support services at your education institution for more information.
     </p>
     <h2 id="eligibility">
      Eligibility
     </h2>
     <p>
      To get either of the 2 bursaries in the 2016 to 2017 academic year you must meet the requirements for your age and residency.  Your study must also meet the conditions:
     </p>
     <h3 id="age">
      Age
     </h3>
     <p>
      You must be aged:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       over 16 at 31 August 2016
      </li>
      <li>
       under 19 at 31 August 2016
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If you aged over 19 you won’t be eligible for the bursary unless you have an Education, Health and Care Plan (ECHP).  You should talk to your institution to see if you get a discretionary bursary while you continue to attend education.  Other students aged over 19 may be able to get other support for older students. Student support services at your education institution will tell you what you can apply for.
     </p>
     <h3 id="residency">
      Residency
     </h3>
     <p>
      You must meet the residency requirements for enrolment.  Your institution will check this.

      If you live in England and travel to Scotland to study, you should contact your home local authority in England to apply for a bursary. You can’t get Scottish EMA.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you’re from England and live in Scotland temporarily to study, for example at a residential college, you will be treated as a Scottish resident and should apply to your host local authority in Scotland for EMA. You can’t get the bursary fund.

     </p>
     <p>
      You may also apply to your institution for a discretionary bursary.  You can’t get a vulnerable bursary.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you live in England and travel to Wales to study, the support you can apply for depends on the type of institution you’re attending:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       if you attend an FE college you should apply for discretionary student support from your college, via the Welsh institution’s Financial Contingency Fund
      </li>
      <li>
       if you attend a special college or school sixth form you should approach your home local authority in England to apply for a discretionary bursary
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      All students living in England and travelling to Wales to study who are in one of the defined vulnerable groups, are eligible for a vulnerable bursary.  If this applies to you, you should approach your local authority in England to apply.
     </p>
     <h2 id="types-of-study">
      Types of study
     </h2>
     <p>
      Your institution should be inspected by a public body such as Ofsted that checks quality.

      It must also be either:
     </p>

     <p>

     <p>
      However, if you don’t have any costs related to your education you won’t get any bursary funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you want to apply, you should speak to student support at your education institution. They will look at your individual case. When they have done this they will let you know if you can apply and how much you could get.
     </p>
     <p>
      Please note that the bursary cannot be used to pay for course fees or exam re-sits.

     <h3 id="young-offenders">
      Young offenders
     </h3>
     <p>
      If you’re a young offender you can apply if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       you’re serving a non custodial sentence
      </li>
      <li>
       you’ve been released early from a custodial sentence (except on temporary licence)
      </li>
      <li>
       you’ve been remanded to a non secure institution
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Institutions should provide you with in-kind support, if possible. This is where you get the things you need such as a meal, course material or a travel pass, instead of money.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can’t apply if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       you’re serving a custodial sentence
      </li>
      <li>
       you’ve been released from a custodial sentence on temporary licence
      </li>
      <li>
       you’ve been remanded to a secure institution
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="how-to-apply">
      How to apply
     </h3>
     <p>
      To apply you need to contact student support services or your tutor at your education institution. They will tell you what to do. There should also be information about applying for the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund on your institution’s website.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should apply as soon as you know where you’re going to study. The sooner you apply, the sooner your support can start. Some institutions may have limited funds available and may allocate funding on a first come first served basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some institutions ask for a new application every year, some only at the start of a course. If you’re unsure, talk to your education institution.
     </p>
     <h3 id="how-youll-be-paid">
      How you’ll be paid
     </h3>
     <p>
      How the bursary is paid is up to individual institutions. It may be paid into your bank account in a lump sum or instalments. You may get cash or a cheque. Or, it might be paid in kind, which means instead of getting money; you could get a travel pass, meal vouchers or course equipment. You might get paid partly in money and partly in kind.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you have any questions about your payment you should talk to your institution. This is because institutions are responsible for deciding who is eligible for the bursary fund, as well as how much each student is awarded, and when the payments will be made.
     </p>
     <h3 id="bank-account">
      Bank account
     </h3>
     <p>
      If you’re 16 years old you can open a basic bank account. This will allow BACS transfers (if your institution wants to pay the money into your bank account) and allow you to withdraw money. If you can’t open a bank account you will need to speak to student support services or your tutor to work out another way for them to pay you.
     </p>
     <h3 id="need-more-help-to-stay-in-education">
      Need more help to stay in education?
     </h3>
     <p>
      Some institutions keep some bursary fund to help students who need emergency help because their circumstances have changed. Others provide one-off support through separate funds which aren’t connected to the bursary. If your circumstances change, speak to student support services at your education institution straight away. They will be able to tell you what to do.

      What the bursary is for
     </h3>
     <p>
      As the bursary is to help pay for things you need to stay in education, institutions can say what you should spend it on. They may also ask for receipts to show what you’ve spent it on.

      Education institutions can set conditions on your bursary. These are rules you need to stick to so you can carry on getting support from the bursary fund. The conditions they set could cover attendance or standards of behaviour. If you don’t stick to them, your payments may be stopped.

      Declaration

     <p>
      If you or your parents or carers give false or incomplete information on your bursary application you may be committing fraud. Details of your application may be passed to the Department for Education or the police. You and your parents or carers could be prosecuted. Your institution will ask you to pay back any payments you should not have had.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the assessment of your application your education institution may do sample checks. They could ask you for further evidence. If that evidence is not provided, or results in a lower award being due, they may stop payments and ask you to pay back any payments you should not have had.
