      All organisations that want to deliver apprenticeship training, including employers, will need to meet the requirements of the register of apprenticeship training providers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The requirements of the register will include due diligence checks on your organisation and directors, financial checks and an assessment of your organisation’s capability to deliver high-quality apprenticeship training.

      Application routes
     </h3>

       <p>
        main route: eligible for selection by levied employers to deliver apprenticeship training, as well as selection by another main provider to work as a subcontractor
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        supporting route: entry route to the apprenticeship market for organisations that offer a specialism, and providers who only want to deliver as a subcontractor
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        employer-provider route: employers who want to provide training to their own staff - they will have the flexibility to lead their own programme, or act as a subcontractor to their appointed main provider
