      Apprenticeships are the ideal way into this industry because of their technical content and all the safety requirements of the job.

     <p>
      The gas industry intermediate level and advanced level apprenticeships cover a range of job roles in the industry. They enable you to train to work in the installation, service and repair of domestic gas appliances.
     </p>
     <p>
      These appliances could include boilers, cookers, central heating systems and fires. Gas installation and service technicians are trained to connect appliances to gas supplies and ensure that everything’s safe, and deal with leaks according to strict safety requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      You’ll assist a gas engineer and learn how to install and maintain gas appliances, working towards registration on the Gas Safe Register - a requirement for anyone performing work on gas appliances. The apprenticeship also covers other aspects of the job, such as systems design, customer service, tools and materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the advanced level apprenticeship you’ll learn to work on more complex systems. Advanced level apprentices will have the option to follow the emergency services path, learning to respond to an emergency, assess the situation and make the necessary repairs.
     </p>
     <p>
      The intermediate level apprenticeship also provides opportunities to work on the national transmission system that transports gas across the country from “beach to burner”. You could learn the skills and knowledge required to lay and maintain gas mains and service pipes.
