      Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">

      ) funds traineeships through institutions having a contract/grant funding agreement. The following information is designed to support institutions in understanding traineeships for the 2016 to 2017 academic year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Traineeships are a demand led programme which can benefit young people if they are within 6 months of being able to get sustainable employment or an apprenticeship.
     </p>
     <p>
      Traineeships were introduced in 2013 and

      As a study programme, a traineeship’s core aim drives retention in funding terms. Completing the work experience core aim means the student is retained. Completion can be either by fulfilling the planned hours or by leaving the core aim early to achieve a successful outcome. There are four possible scenarios which define retention, funding and outcomes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the trainee completes the planned hours on the core aim and progresses to a successful outcome – which is retained in funding terms and positive in quality terms or
      </li>
      <li>
       the trainee completes the planned hours on the core aim but does not progress to a successful outcome – which is retained in funding terms, but negative in quality terms or
      </li>
      <li>
       the trainee leaves the core aim early and progresses to a successful outcome – which is retained in funding terms and positive in quality terms or
      </li>
      <li>
       the trainee leaves early and does not achieve a successful outcome - which is negative in retention terms and negative in quality terms

      and be able to record evidence of good educational reasons for any individual students recruited to programmes which do not provide progression. All such students should only make up a small percentage of the total student cohort.

      If a learner does not complete the English and maths elements of the traineeship within 6 months then these will continue to be funded until they are completed.

      Delivering a successful traineeship

     <p>
      The primary objective of a traineeship is to progress the trainee to an apprenticeship or other sustainable jobs. Alternatively, the trainee could enrol on a course of further learning including a full time study programme at level 2 or 3.
     </p>
     <h3 id="work-experience">
      Work experience
     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of traineeships is to prepare young people for employment so that they are able to progress successfully to apprenticeships and other sustainable jobs. Work experience in traineeships should give the young person experience of a real workplace so they can develop the skills, knowledge, confidence, attitudes and behaviours they need to succeed at work. Ideally, this should be with an external employer, external to the learning environment and at an external site. However, exceptions to this will be funded. For example, local authorities with a training arm where the direct provision of training is clearly not the local authority’s core business, work experience within departments which are separate to the training arm counts as external work experience.
     </p>
     <p>
      In these cases providers will need to make a judgement about whether their work placements genuinely provide students with the experiences they need to develop the work-related attributes expected of a traineeship. Ultimately Ofsted make judgements about the suitability of these arrangements through inspection and grading of providers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Simulated activity in an artificial environment may well form a helpful part of work preparation training but will not count as work placements for the purposes of traineeships.
