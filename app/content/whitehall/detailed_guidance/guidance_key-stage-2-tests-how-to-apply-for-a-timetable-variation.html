      Some pupils may be able to take a test at a different time from the rest of the cohort, subject to strict criteria.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools can use a start time variation or a timetable variation to change the 2017 key stage 2 test timetable. Both must be authorised by the headteacher before submission to STA on NCA tools.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can use a start time variation to vary the test time between 7am and 7pm on the day of a test, so that a pupil can take a test on the scheduled date, but at a different time from the rest of the cohort.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can use a timetable variation to vary the test time to a different day, up to 5 school days after the day specified in the statutory timetable.
     </p>
     <div class="call-to-action">
      <p>
       Under no circumstances may a test be taken before the day specified in the statutory timetable.

       You must complete the appropriate form in the ‘Access arrangements’ section of
       <a href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk" rel="external">
        NCA tools
       </a>
       . You may find it helpful to watch our
       <a href="https://registration.livegroup.co.uk/sta" rel="external">

       demonstrating how to notify STA of a start time variation or apply for a timetable variation.
      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      Timetable variations and start time variations will only be granted if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       pupils take the test(s) at the nominated time(s)
      </li>
      <li>
       STA are informed of any variation to the nominated time(s)
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupils are kept apart from other pupils who have taken the test(s)
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupils haven’t discussed the tests on the internet or social media
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      It is maladministration for a school to vary the test timetable without permission from STA or without having notified us. Incorrect use of timetable variations could lead to the annulment of pupils’ results.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you are in any doubt about which type of timetable variation is most appropriate, contact the national curriculum assessments helpline on 0300 303 3013.

     <div class="call-to-action">
      <p>
       You must notify us if you are going to make a start time variation for individual pupils between 7am and 7pm on the day of a test. In the interests of their welfare, pupils must not take the tests before 7am or after 7pm.
      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      You may move the time of a test on the scheduled day if, for example:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a pupil was ill and is now in a fit state to take the test
      </li>
      <li>
       a pupil arrives late
      </li>
      <li>
       you need to stagger the tests because you have a large cohort but not enough staff to administer the tests to all pupils at the same time
      </li>
      <li>
       you have a number of pupils who need readers, translators or scribes and you don’t have enough staff to support them if they were to take the test at the same time
      </li>
      <li>
       you need to move a test to the afternoon so you can arrange for a scribe because a pupil arrives in school on the morning of a scheduled test with a broken arm
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="approval">
      Approval
     </h3>
     <p>
      Before the test is administered you must notify STA using an online ‘Start time variation’ form in the ‘Access arrangements’ section of NCA tools. STA will not approve or reject notifications so you do not need to wait for a response before administering the test to the pupil.
     </p>
     <p>
      Headteachers must authorise any proposed start time variations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools must not administer a start time variation unless the headteacher can confirm that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the content of the test(s) has remained confidential
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupil has not been in contact with any of the pupils who have already taken the test(s)
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupil has not had access to the test materials via the internet or social media
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Headteachers may wish to contact the pupil’s parents to confirm that the integrity of the tests has been maintained.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a pupil has had contact with pupils who have taken the test or had access to the test materials via the internet, the pupil must not take the test and should be marked as ‘A’ (absent) on the attendance register.

      <p>
       To move the test to a different day you must submit an online ‘Application for a timetable variation’ form in the ‘Access arrangements’ section of NCA tools. You can apply to move a test up to 5 school days after the date specified in the statutory timetable. You must not administer the test until we have approved your application.
      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      We will consider your application if a pupil:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       is absent on the day of the test due to illness
      </li>
      <li>
       has an important appointment that can’t be rearranged, for example, a hospital appointment, a court appearance or national / international sports participation
      </li>
      <li>
       is observing a religious or cultural festival
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We will also consider applications if your school:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       is being used as a polling station for local or general elections, if it isn’t possible to continue with test administration in another part of the school
      </li>
      <li>
       has to deal with unforeseeable problems, for example, flooding
      </li>
      <li>
       has a short working day, for example, in a pupil referral unit
      </li>
      <li>
       has received its test materials late, so that it can’t administer the tests on the scheduled dates
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We will not allow the test timetable to be changed for:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       unauthorised absence
      </li>
      <li>
       family holidays

       If a pupil is absent on the day of the test, wait until the pupil has returned to school before making an application. We will not accept applications unless we are sure which day the test will be taken on.
      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      During test week and the following timetable variation week, you need to allow up to 2 hours for your application to be processed. Please bear this in mind when submitting your application. The pupil must only take the test after the application has been approved by STA.
     </p>
     <p>
      You will receive an email to tell you that your application has been updated. You should then login to the NCA tools website to check the status of the application.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pupils taking the test with a timetable variation should be marked as ‘✔’ (present for the test) on the attendance register once the test has been administered. They should not be marked as ‘F’ (taking the test in a future year).
