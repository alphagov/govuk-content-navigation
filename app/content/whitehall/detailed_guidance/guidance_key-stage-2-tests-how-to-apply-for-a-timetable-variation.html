      You can use a timetable variation to vary the test time:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       to a different day, up to 5 school days after the day specified in the statutory timetable
      </li>

      All timetable variations must be approved by the headteacher before submission to STA.
Schools can use 2 types of timetable variation. Both must be approved by the headteacher. Timetable variations can be used to change the statutory timetable:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       by up to a week (5 school days) after the day specified in the statutory timetable
      </li>
      <li>
       so that an individual child can take a test on the scheduled date, but separately from the rest of the cohort, between 7am and 7pm on the day of a test
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Under no circumstances may a test be taken before the day specified in the statutory timetable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Timetable variations will only be granted if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       pupils take the test(s) at the nominated time(s)
      </li>
      <li>
       we are informed of any variation to the nominated time(s)
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupils are kept apart from other pupils who have taken the test(s)
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupils haven’t discussed the tests on the internet
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      It is maladministration for a school to vary the statutory test timetable without us giving permission or a school providing notification to us, as appropriate. This could lead to the annulment of pupils’ results.
If you are in any doubt about the type of timetable variation to make, contact the

      You need to allow up to an hour for your application to be processed. Please bear this in mind when submitting your application. The pupil must not take the test until the application has been formally approved.
