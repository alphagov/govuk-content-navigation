         All timetable variations must be approved by the headteacher before submission to STA.
Schools can use 2 types of timetable variation. Both must be approved by the headteacher. Timetable variations can be used to change the statutory timetable:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          by up to a week (5 school days) after the day specified in the statutory timetable
         </li>
         <li>
          so that an individual child can take a test on the scheduled date, but separately from the rest of the cohort, between 7am and 7pm on the day of a test
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Under no circumstances may a test be taken before the day specified in the statutory timetable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Timetable variations will only be granted if:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          pupils take the test(s) at the nominated time(s)
         </li>
         <li>
          we are informed of any variation to the nominated time(s)
         </li>
         <li>
          the pupils are kept apart from other pupils who have taken the test(s)
         </li>
         <li>
          the pupils haven’t discussed the tests on the internet
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         It is maladministration for a school to vary the statutory test timetable without us giving permission or a school providing notification to us, as appropriate. This could lead to the annulment of pupils’ results.
