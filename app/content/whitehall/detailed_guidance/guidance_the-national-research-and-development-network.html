       Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
       The national research and development network makes research more accessible to schools. It supports teaching school alliances to engage in research and development activities with their higher education institution partners and in regional and national networks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It undertakes research with schools on priority topics and themes agreed by teaching schools. This will provide:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a practical understanding of how to address the important issues facing teaching schools
       </li>
       <li>
        an evidence base which can contribute to school improvement and practice
       </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="closing-the-gap-test-and-learn">
       Closing the gap: test and learn
      </h2>
      <p>
       This project tested school and classroom approaches to improving pupil attainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over 200 teaching schools alliances worked together to carry out 11 large-scale randomised controlled trials, where 1 group of pupils is taught using a new method and another group is taught in the usual way and their performance compared. Some schools went on to design and run their own smaller trials using similar experimental research methods.

      <p>
       ​More public services are using evidence-based approaches to improve practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this project 20 teaching schools are developing their expertise in evidence-based teaching. They are exploring different approaches to embedding it within their schools and across their alliances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Participant schools will:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        produce materials to support other schools
       </li>
       <li>
        identify promising approaches that may warrant further robust and rigorous testing and evaluation
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       We will publish a report in summer 2016.

       Research and development network themes

      <p>
       The network agreed 3 national themes for their research activities in autumn 2011. Teaching school alliances have agreed and pursued their own particular focus within a theme. They work with a national research team alongside their own university partner. They are also aligning with and contributing to the work of other alliances under the same theme.

       <abbr title="national leader of education">
        NLE
