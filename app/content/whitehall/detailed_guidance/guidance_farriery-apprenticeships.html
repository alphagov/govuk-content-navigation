      This apprenticeship is the only way to qualify as a registered farrier in Great Britain. A farrier is a skilled craftsperson who makes and fits shoes for horses’ feet according to the needs and welfare of the animal. Increasingly, farriers work with veterinary surgeons and equine hospitals to provide corrective shoeing and surgical farriery.

     <p>
      Roughly 100 apprentices are taken on in the industry every year, and competition for places is quite strong. Candidates must serve a period of apprenticeship of 4 years and 2 months while employed by an approved training farrier (ATF).
     </p>
     <p>
      You’ll learn specialist skills, such as how to assess the needs of a particular animal, making and modifying tools and shoes by forging, and trimming and shoeing equine feet. You’ll be trained in blacksmithing to make or modify horseshoes correctly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once qualified and registered, you can become your own boss and work hours that suit you and your clients.
