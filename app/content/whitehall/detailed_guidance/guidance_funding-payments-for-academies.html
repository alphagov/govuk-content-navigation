      Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      ) is responsible for paying academies in accordance with the terms set out in the academy’s funding agreement. The General Annual Grant (
      <abbr title="general annual grant">
       GAG
      </abbr>
      ) is the name for an academy’s main revenue funding. We issue a monthly remittance note for each payment.

     <h2 id="remittance-advice-note">

      We’ve produced a

     <p>
      We fund academies on an academic rather than financial year basis. We send the monthly
      <abbr title="general annual grant">
       GAG
      </abbr>
      payments via BACS to arrive in the academy’s nominated bank account on the first working day of each month. We distribute
      <abbr title="general annual grant">
       GAG
      </abbr>
      funding in equal instalments throughout the year. This ensures consistency across all state-funded schools. The first payment for the 2016 to 2017 academic year is in September 2016.
