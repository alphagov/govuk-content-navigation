     <p>
      An initial teacher education (
      <abbr title="Initial teacher education">
       ITE
      </abbr>
      ) partnership will get a call 2 working days before the inspection begins. The inspection support administrator from Ofsted will contact the partnership to let it know about the inspection and email a notification letter.
     </p>

     </h2>
     <p>
      <abbr title="Initial teacher education">
       ITE
      </abbr>
      partnerships will set out the inspection timetable in discussion with the lead inspector and make practical arrangements for the inspection team.
     </p>
     <p>
      The partnership is given a letter to send by email to any school, college or other setting inspectors will visit as part of the
      <abbr title="Initial teacher education">
       ITE
      </abbr>
      inspection.
     </p>
     <h2 id="during-the-inspection-visit">
      During the inspection visit
     </h2>
     <p>
      Inspectors spend as much time as possible gathering first-hand evidence about the quality of training across the partnership. This involves observations of:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       school, college and/or setting and/or centre-based training delivered by mentors and trainers
      </li>
      <li>
       trainees’ and former trainees’ teaching
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Lead inspectors may ask for some teaching observations to be jointly carried out with mentors and/or trainers. For these observations, the mentor or trainer rather than the inspector would give feedback to the trainee.
     </p>
     <h2 id="after-the-inspection-visit">
      After the inspection visit
     </h2>
     <p>
      The lead inspector writes a report about the main inspection findings.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <abbr title="Initial teacher education">
       ITE
      </abbr>
      partnership gets the inspection report within 15 working days of the end of the inspection to check its factual accuracy. They will have 5 working days to respond.
     </p>
     <p>
      The final report is sent to the partnership within 23 working days of the end of the inspection and
      <a href="http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">
       the report is published online
      </a>
      , normally within 28 working days of the end of the inspection.

     <h2 id="complaints-about-an-inspection">
