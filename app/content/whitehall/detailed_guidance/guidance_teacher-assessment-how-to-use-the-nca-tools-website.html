      <abbr title="unique pupil number">
       UPN

      and they have now been allocated a permanent
      <abbr title="unique pupil number">
       UPN
      </abbr>
      , you can correct it by uploading that pupil again with their new
      <abbr title="unique pupil number">
       UPN
      </abbr>
      . Do not change any of the other details otherwise NCA tools will view this as a new pupil.

      If a pupil has been uploaded with the wrong name or date of birth then as long as this matches what’s shown in the spreadsheet template, no further action needs to be taken.
     </p>
     <p>
      The details in the spreadsheet are those which were confirmed during pupil registration so if you make changes to this information it may delay
      <abbr title="Standards and Testing Agency">
       STA
      </abbr>
      when matching the
      <abbr title="teacher assessment">
       TA
      </abbr>
      result to the test result.
     </p>
     <p>
      You will be able to make amendments during the school performance tables checking exercise. If these details do not match what is held in the spreadsheet, eg if it is a new pupil that has been added with the wrong details, or appears in the
      <abbr title="common transfer file">
       CTF
      </abbr>
      from the
      <abbr title="management information system">
       MIS
      </abbr>
      incorrectly, you can correct by uploading the file again with the new details.
     </p>
     <p>
      If NCA tools does not recognise it as the same pupil, it may create a duplicate. You should then delete the incorrect pupil from your submission (see
      <a href="#wrong-pupil">
       Wrong pupil uploaded
      </a>
      ).

      When to delete a pupil
     </h3>
     <p>
      A pupil should only be deleted from your
      <abbr title="teacher assessment">
       TA
      </abbr>
      submission if they were uploaded in error. Corrections to
      <abbr title="teacher assessment">
       TA
      </abbr>
      can be made by submitting another file which will refresh data, but will not remove data or pupils that have already been submitted.
     </p>
     <p>
      A pupil can be deleted if they:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       are not at the end of key stage 2
      </li>
      <li>
       were not a registered pupil at your school during test week
      </li>
      <li>
       are a duplicate, ie the pupil exists more than once in the submission (this may occur if the pupil was uploaded more than once but with different details)
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A pupil should not be deleted in the following cases.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       They have been uploaded with incorrect
       <abbr title="teacher assessment">
        TA
       </abbr>
       levels. These can be corrected by uploading another file which will refresh the data.
      </li>
      <li>
       They did not sit the tests because they were working below the level, unable to access the tests or were absent on the day of the tests. You should submit their
       <abbr title="teacher assessment">
        TA
       </abbr>
       levels, or appropriate code if an assessment cannot be made (see the ‘Teacher assessment’ section of the key stage 2 ‘Assessment and reporting arrangements’).
      </li>
      <li>
       They were registered during pupil registration and appear in the expected pupil list on the spreadsheet template.
       <abbr title="Standards and Testing Agency">

       level or appropriate code for all registered pupils. If the pupil left the school prior to test week you should record them as ‘L’ for all subjects.
