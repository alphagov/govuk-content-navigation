     <p>
      Top-up funding is for academies with specific and exceptional circumstances that may result in their being unable to meet the full cost of insurance premiums from their funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Insurance related VAT, motor insurance and insurance to cover staff absence are not eligible for reimbursement. Health and safety risk assessments and business continuity planning are also not eligible, nor will insurance premium tax be reimbursed on ineligible items.
     </p>
     <p>
      The claim form for policies of more than one year taken out before February 2014 to cover the period through to August 2017 is now available. The first payment will be available from January 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      The period to August 2017 is the last year that top-up funding for additional insurance costs will be available. This is following the response to
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/risk-protection-arrangement-for-academy-trusts">
       consultation on risk protection arrangements for academy trusts
      </a>

      to claim for top-up funding for insurance for the 2015 to 2016 academic year. Academies that have already claimed for insurance top-up funding that includes a period from September 2016 onwards will have an appropriate adjustment made automatically to their funding. These academies will be advised prior to the adjustment being made.

      <abbr title="risk protection arrangement">
       RPA

      ) for academy trusts was announced. When claiming, the academy will need:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Their URN
      </li>
      <li>
       The date the policy was obtained

      </li>
      <li>

       Academies need to submit an
       <a href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/nndr" rel="external">
        online form
       </a>
       to claim funding for national non-domestic rates (
       <abbr title="national non-domestic rates">
        NNDR
       </abbr>
       ). Academies can use the form to make claims for the 2015 to 2016 financial year and, from 31 March 2015, the 2016 to 2017 financial year.
      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      To make a claim, academies will need their URN (available from
      <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/edubase/home.xhtml" rel="external">
       Edubase
      </a>
      ) and their
      <abbr title="national non-domestic rates">
       NNDR
      </abbr>
      bills for the 2015 to 2016 and the 2016 to 2017 financial years. This is so that they can give the values for both years in full, prior to any relief being applied and for the full 12 month period. Only the bill values are required when making a claim,
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      does not need a copy of the actual bills. You should, however, hold these records and provide them where necessary for audit purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Academies without a predecessor will not have a historic bill and should enter £0 for this element. If an academy opened in the financial year being claimed for, they should recalculate the bill they hold to reflect a full year without relief applied. They should enter this full year value into the form.  The form will then calculate the payment to show the amount due for the remainder of the financial year. Academies should check the displayed value matches their required funding amount. Depending on monthly payment deadlines,
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      will make one payment within 2 months of receiving a claim.
     </p>
     <p>
      <abbr title="national non-domestic rates">
       NNDR
      </abbr>
      claims should only be submitted for academy buildings.  Rented facilities are not eligible for
      <abbr title="national non-domestic rates">

      funding.
