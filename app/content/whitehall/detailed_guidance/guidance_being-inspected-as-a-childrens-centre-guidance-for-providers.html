      The inspection will look at how you:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       help families with young children access your services, including those families who find it difficult or are unwilling to do so
      </li>
      <li>
       improve the wellbeing of young children and their families

     <p>
      Your inspection can take place at any time.
     </p>
     <p>
      How often you are inspected will depend on how well you are doing, so some centres will be inspected more often than others.

     <h2 id="getting-notice-of-an-inspection">
      Getting notice of an inspection
     </h2>
     <p>
      You will normally get up to 3 days’ notice of an inspection, unless there are concerns related to children’s welfare

     <h2 id="before-the-inspection">

     <p>
      The lead inspector will explain what you need to do to prepare for the inspection.
     </p>
     <p>
      You or your local authority will need to give the lead inspector:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       details of how the centre is run and managed
      </li>
      <li>

       , action plan and activity programme; there is guidance to help you with your self-evaluation
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      You must tell families using the centre an inspection is going to take place and how they can meet inspectors. You must also tell the local authority and partner agencies.

     <h2 id="during-the-inspection">
      During the inspection

     <p>
      Inspectors will gather evidence including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       information from you, the local authority and partner agencies
      </li>
      <li>
       your self-evaluation
      </li>
      <li>
       how families benefit from your services
      </li>
      <li>
       inspections of the Early Years Foundation Stage for the centre’s registered childcare providers
      </li>
     </ul>

      Inspectors will:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       observe activities
      </li>
      <li>
       interview centre leaders/key contacts, staff, parents, prospective parents, and others, such as childminders
      </li>
      <li>
       look at policies and procedures
      </li>
      <li>
       give you feedback

     </ul>
     <h2 id="after-the-inspection">

     <p>
      You will have a feedback meeting where inspectors will tell you the judgements and explain any aspects judged inadequate or outstanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      The inspector will send you and the local authority a report with your judgements. The local authority has 2 months to prepare an action plan in response to the report’s recommendations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspection reports are usually
      <a href="http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">
       published online
      </a>
      within 15 working days of the inspection. If the centre’s overall effectiveness is judged inadequate, the report is published within 25 working days.
