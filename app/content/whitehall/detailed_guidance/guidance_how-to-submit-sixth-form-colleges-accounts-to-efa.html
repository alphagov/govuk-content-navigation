     <p>
      This guide explains how to submit your sixth-form college’s audited accounts and auditor’s management letter to the Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      ) via Document Exchange. It does not apply to further education colleges, who must submit their accounts to the Skills Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Skills Funding Agency">
       SFA
      </abbr>
      ).
     </p>
     <h2 id="how-and-when-to-submit-your-accounts">
      How and when to submit your accounts
     </h2>
     <p>
      Sixth-form colleges must submit their accounts for the year ending 31 July 2015 to
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      by 31 December 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      You will need to submit them online via Document Exchange. This is a facility within the
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      Information Exchange which allows secure upload of documents via a single online system.
     </p>
     <p>
      To access Document Exchange, sixth-form colleges must use the Department for Education’s
      <a href="https://sa.education.gov.uk/idp/Authn/UserPassword" rel="external">
       Secure Access system
      </a>
      . Most sixth form colleges will already have used Document Exchange for other returns, but if you are new to it, you should read the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/efa-information-exchange">
       guidance on requesting support with Information Exchange
      </a>
      .

     <h2 id="what-documents-to-submit">
      What documents to submit

      As set out in the

       colleges’ accounts direction
      </a>
      , sixth-form colleges must submit the following documents to
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      , by 31 December 2015, for the year ending 31 July 2015:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       audited financial statements
      </li>
      <li>

      How to upload your documents to Document Exchange
     </h2>
     <p>
      It is important that sixth-form colleges follow the instructions for uploading documents to Document Exchange. Failure to do so may lead to delays in processing documents, including additional follow-up queries from
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      .
     </p>
     <div class="call-to-action">
      <p>
       You must:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        upload all of your documents to the folder called Finance and Payments &gt; AY 2014-15 on Document Exchange: once logged in, you will need to go to the Finance and Payments folder first, and then click on the sub-folder AY 2014-15
       </li>
       <li>
        name your documents using the following naming convention: CollegeCode_201415_SUFFIX
       </li>
      </ul>
     </div>
     <p>
      You can find the 5-digit sixth-form college code on the cover sheet of your college’s finance record.
Each document must be labelled with the correct suffix, as set out in the table below:
     </p>
     <table>
      <tbody>
       <tr>
        <td>
         Documents for the year ended 31 July 2015
        </td>
        <td>

        </td>
       </tr>
       <tr>

       </tr>
       <tr>

       </tr>
       <tr>

       </tr>
       <tr>

       </tr>
      </tbody>
     </table>
     <p>
      Once you are in the sub-folder AY 2014-15, you will be able to upload your documents:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Select Actions, and then click on Upload Content
      </li>
      <li>
       A Document Purpose drop-down box will appear. Select Financial Statements (SFC) from the drop-down list
      </li>
      <li>
       Browse for your file, then select Upload
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Document Purpose box was added to the system on 16 December 2015. If you had already submitted your documents before that date, you don’t need to submit them again.
     </p>
     <p>
      You will need to repeat these steps to upload your other documents, ie your finance record, auditor’s management letter and annual report of the audit committee.
     </p>
     <p>
      When your documents have been uploaded and submitted, they will be immediately visible within Document Exchange. You will receive no further confirmation of receipt.
