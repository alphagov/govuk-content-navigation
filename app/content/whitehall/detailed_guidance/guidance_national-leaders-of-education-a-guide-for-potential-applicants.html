     <p>
      National leaders of education (
      <abbr title="national leaders of education">
       NLEs
      </abbr>
      ) are strong school leaders, who have experience of effectively supporting schools in challenging circumstances.
      <abbr title="national leaders of education">
       NLEs
      </abbr>
      work alongside teaching schools and other system leaders to provide high quality support to those who need it most.

       eligibility criteria
      </a>
      you might want to apply to become a national leader of education. The National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) has now introduced a more sophisticated and balanced approach to designating system leaders – one which relies less heavily on Ofsted judgements and more on timely and accurate data, and the skills and track record of those applying.
     </p>
     <p>
      Together these improvements will help to ensure that more of the most effective school leaders and schools are able to provide high quality support, especially in areas of the country where this support is most needed.

      Target areas

     <p>
      Tranche 22 is a targeted application round focusing on areas of greatest need to ensure that all schools can access high-quality support. If you can provide support to schools in the
      <a href="#target-areas-for-tranche-21">
       target areas
      </a>
      , even if you’re situated outside of a target area, please specify how you would do this within your application. Your application will be considered on an individual basis by the designation panel.

      If you’re selected as an

      , your school will become a national support school (
      <abbr title="national support school">

      To become an
      <abbr title="national leader of education">
       NLE
      </abbr>
      , you and your school need to meet very specific criteria.
     </p>
     <p>
      You need to have:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a track record of strong school leadership with at least 3 years headship experience
      </li>
      <li>
       a track record of providing effective school-to-school support which has led to improved outcomes for pupils over a sustained period
      </li>
      <li>
       the full support from the school’s governing body and a reference from a commissioner of school-to-school support
      </li>

      For your school to qualify as an
