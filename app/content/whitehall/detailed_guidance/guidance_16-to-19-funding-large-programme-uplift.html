     <p>
      This note sets out the conditions under which the EFA will pay a large programme uplift. It provides further information to institutions to support them in understanding and planning for the large programme uplift.
     </p>
     <p>
      It also sets out the requirements for study programmes to meet the large programme uplift, that is, to be of high quality, and to provide students with substantial stretch and challenge.
     </p>
     <h3 id="purpose">
      Purpose
     </h3>
     <p>
      The introduction of study programmes in academic year 2013 to 2014 funded full time programmes at an average of 600 hours. At that time Ministers recognised that there were a small number of study programmes that were necessarily much larger than 600 hours, in order to prepare students for work or some university courses.
     </p>
     <p>
      A ministerial announcement in July 2014  set out the policy for a large programme uplift for the start of academic year 2016 to 2017. It was timed so that institutions would be aware of the arrangements when offering study programmes for the start of the academic year 2014 to 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of the large programme uplift is to contribute to the costs of necessarily large study programmes where they are of high quality and provide substantial stretch and challenge.
     </p>
     <p>

      Definition of the large programme uplift
     </h2>
     <p>
      The large programme uplift reflects that some study programmes are necessarily much larger than 600 hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      The large programme uplift is by exception and is only available for high quality study programmes providing students with substantial stretch and challenge. For example programmes of 4 or more full A levels, the full level 3 International Baccalaureate (IB), and some large, level 3, Technical Baccalaureate (TechBacc) programmes. The uplift is paid where a set quality threshold is met.
     </p>
     <p>
      Details about programmes which meet the

       TechBacc measure
      </a>
      can be found on GOV.UK.
     </p>
     <p>
      An uplift of either 10% or 20% to the full time national funding rate per student will be applied to
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-funding-large-programme-uplift#large-techbacc-programmes">
       large programmes
      </a>
      that meet the criteria set out in this note. The 10% and 20% uplifts will be calculated based on the national funding rate for the relevant academic year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The uplift is only paid for 2 years for each student aged 16 and 17, that is academic years 12 and 13 only. Those large programmes taking longer than 2 years generate no additional uplift.

      Students covered by the large programme uplift
     </h2>
     <p>
      The large programme uplift only applies to those 16 and 17 year olds studying on large programmes that meet the size and
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-funding-large-programme-uplift#definition-of-the-large-programme-uplift">
       achievement criteria
      </a>
      set out in this note.
     </p>
     <p>
      Students aged 19 to 24 who have an Education Health and Care Plan (EHCP) can qualify for a large programme uplift.
     </p>
     <p>
      Students on traineeships, apprenticeships, and supported internships do not qualify for a large programme uplift.
     </p>
     <h2 id="large-a-level-programmes">
      Large A level programmes
     </h2>
     <p>
      Large A level programmes (identified by A2 qualifications and the new 2 year linear A level qualifications) will attract an uplift.
     </p>
     <p>
      AS levels do not count towards the large programme uplift. A2 levels or linear A levels in General Studies and Critical Thinking are also not included. Other than advising these 2 subjects are excluded, we do not expect to give detailed advice on the content or delivery of large programmes.
     </p>
     <h3 id="pre-u-qualifications">
      Pre U Qualifications
     </h3>
     <p>
      A Pre U Principal or Research subject certificate graded at M1 or higher (not including 1 year short programmes) is equivalent to 1 A level for the purpose of the uplift. The Pre U certificate has to be part of a programme that is equivalent to 4 A levels or more to qualify. This can be all Pre U certificates or a mixture of Pre U certificates and A levels within a large programme. Pre Us are listed on Learning Aims Reference Service (LARS) and can be found by searching for “

     <p>
      Students who achieve 4 full A2 or linear A level qualifications at grade B or better, in each A level, will qualify for an uplift of 10% to the full time national funding rate for the academic year in which the allocation is made.

     </p>
     <p>
      A student who is enrolled on a study programme of 5 full A levels but only achieved grade B or better in 4 of them will attract the 10% uplift.

     <h2 id="large-international-baccalaureate-ib-programmes">
      Large International Baccalaureate (IB) Programmes
     </h2>
     <p>
      The full level 3 International Baccalaureate Diploma is necessarily a large programme as the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) stipulates that the teaching time for the IB must add up to 1450-1500 hours across the 2 years of the programme.
     </p>
     <p>
      Students who complete the full level 3 Diploma and achieve 28 or more points will attract a 20% uplift to the full time national funding rate for the year in which the allocation is made. 28 points is broadly equivalent to grade B at A level.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a student achieves a pass with 24 points, but does not achieve 28 points, then no uplift will be paid.

     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>

     </p>
     <p>
      Attainment data arising from the examination of these qualifications in academic year 2017 to 2018 will be used to calculate allocations from academic year 2020 to 2021, as the attainment data from academic year 2016 to 2017 will not be available until early 2019. This is too late for the 2019 to 2020 allocations. Prior to 2020 to 2021 allocations payment will be calculated on the number of students passing all 3 qualifications.

      How the uplift will be calculated
     </h2>
     <p>
      The uplift will operate in the existing lagged system, that is, lagged student numbers based on the previous academic year as recorded in the autumn school census, ILR R04 and end year HESA data.
     </p>
     <p>
      The students attracting the large programme uplift will be separately identified from the last full year for which we have historic attainment data and split into those attracting the 10% uplift and those attracting the 20% uplift. Students will be identified through their learning aims recorded for year 12 and the uplift will be doubled to apply the uplift for 2 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      From this data a total uplift funding value will be calculated and added to the end of the funding formula. The uplift will be applied after retention, programme cost weighting and disadvantage has been applied to the national funding rate per student. The uplift will attract the area cost uplift where it applies.

      As the criteria for implementation of the uplift includes student attainment, which will rely on data matched in from the National Pupil Database, there will be a 3 year lag. This means, for example, that for allocations for the academic year 2016 to 2017 we will use attainment data from 2013 to 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions will receive detailed advice applicable to each academic year in the general advice note supplied with their allocation.
     </p>
     <h2 id="data-collection">
      Data collection
     </h2>
     <p>
      There are no additional data collection requirements for the large programme uplift. All large programmes must be accurately recorded in funding data to meet the criteria for the uplift in future funding allocations. This is because funding of large programmes is based on prior years’ data. Therefore aims must be entered accurately. There is no additional data checking process for the large programme uplift.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutions that believe this methodology does not reflect their delivery will be able to submit business cases in the allocations window (announced each year). Successful challenge to a large programme uplift must demonstrate that the EFA has not correctly interpreted historical attainment data. Incorrect recording of data is not grounds for a successful challenge.

      Background on large programmes funding
     </h2>
     <p>
      Funding for 16-19 year olds changed from academic year 2013 to 2014 with the introduction of study programmes and funding per student, as recommended by Professor Alison Wolf in her
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-vocational-education-the-wolf-report">
       review of vocational education
      </a>
      , which can be viewed on GOV.UK.
     </p>
     <p>
      600 hours per academic year is the average number of hours in a full time study programme. However there have been concerns that some programmes over 600 hours would be discontinued due to funding not being sufficient for institutions to continue to teach programmes necessarily much larger than 600 hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is important to note that the concern was for a specific set of programmes that would be lost, not for all programmes larger than 600 hours. At that time Ministers recognised that there were a small number of study programmes that were necessarily much larger than 600 hours, in order to prepare students for work or some university courses. It was also recognised that some careers, such as medicine, physics/maths/engineering and some skills/technically based careers demand stretching entry standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      The July 2014 announcement by Minister of State for Skills and Equalities Nick Boles MP said additional funding would be available to institutions to fund programmes that stretch and challenge their most able students.
     </p>
     <p>
      In his ministerial statement on 22 July Nick Boles said
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our funding should support all young people to fulfil their potential. And it is vital that schools are encouraged to offer their brightest students the broadest possible range of qualifications at age 16.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Alongside reforms to academic and technical qualifications, this announcement demonstrates our support for schools and colleges to stretch and challenge all their students.”
