      Assistant practitioners are employees within healthcare that work alongside other health professionals such as nurses, doctors, therapists and radiographers.

      The work environment will depend on your role and can vary from working in the community, at clinics or patient’s homes, to being in a hospital setting.
     </p>
     <p>
      Assistant practitioner placements can be designed to work in either a specific field such as nursing or to be an assistant to several departments in a hybrid role.
     </p>
     <p>
      Often employees in this profession become specialists in their job role and end up studying further to work higher up in their field eg choosing to study a degree in midwifery or nursing.
