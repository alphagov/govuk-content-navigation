      Formulating an exams policy

     <p>
      It is good practice for exam centres to have an exams policy. An effective exams policy clearly sets out:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the process the centre will follow to plan and manage exams
      </li>
      <li>
       the roles and responsibilities of different members of staff in relation to exams

      when formulating your centre’s exams policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Centres should also make sure they identify potential risks relating to the administration and management of exams so they can decide what measures to take to prevent and manage these risks.
