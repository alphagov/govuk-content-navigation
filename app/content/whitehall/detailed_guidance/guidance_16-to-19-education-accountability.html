     <p>
      It is important young people and their parents are able to make informed choices about where they will continue their education or training post-16. In order to do this they need to be able to compare the performance of schools and colleges in a fair and consistent way.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the same time, we need to raise standards so all young people are participating in good or outstanding schools and colleges, and we need to hold schools and colleges to account for their performance. In April 2013, the Department for Education (
      <abbr title="Department for Education">
       DfE
      </abbr>
      ), jointly with the then Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (
      <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">
       BIS
      </abbr>
      ) published

     </p>
     <p>
      Where a provider of education or training to 16 to 19 year olds is under-performing, the Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      ) will implement the
      <abbr title="Department for Education">
       DfE
      </abbr>
      policy in line with its contracts and funding agreements. The contracts and funding agreements provide the detail and take precedence over information on this page.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are two triggers that identify if education or training to 16 to 19 year olds is under-performing. These triggers are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       an overall Ofsted judgement of inadequate (or, in the case of a maintained school sixth-form or an academy sixth-form if the separate sixth-form grade states the sixth-form is inadequate); or
      </li>
      <li>
       performance below the National Minimum Standard set each year.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      In addition to education standards, there is also a trigger based on the assessment of the financial health and/or control of institutions made by
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      .
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       where financial health and/or control is assessed as inadequate
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Apprenticeship quality will continue to be assessed against the Minimum Levels of Performance applied by Skills Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Skills Funding Agency">
       SFA
      </abbr>
      ). Apprenticeships are therefore not covered further by this section.

      If a school sixth-form, including academy sixth-forms and 16 to 19 academies is judged inadequate by Ofsted, Regional School Commissioners will consider appropriate improvement action in the first instance. Local Authorities should issue warning notices to LA maintained school sixth-forms.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a sixth-form college is judged inadequate by Ofsted,
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      Director for Young People, in his capacity as Sixth-Form College Commissioner, may undertake an assessment of the capacity and capability of the Sixth-Form College’s current leadership and management to lead improvement, and make recommendations to the minister about the appropriate intervention action in each case. An inadequate inspection judgement may also attract a Notice to Improve that sets out additional conditions that must be met in a time bound period in order to receive continued funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      FE colleges will be subject to an assessment by the FE Commissioner.

      assesses the financial health and financial control of sixth-form colleges. It also carries out an assessment for those CCPs funded only by it or where it is agreed with the

     <p>
      All financial intervention is underpinned by a framework of six key principles. These are:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>
        the protection of the taxpayer from excessive or unnecessary expenditure or future liabilities
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        the protection of high quality and relevant education and training to meet the needs of local learners and employers
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        that the future provision of education and training will be determined on an area-wide basis rather than from a single institution’s perspective, with options explored openly and transparently, and with analysis to be publicly available of both the current and future economic and educational needs and the current education and training provision
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        that provision must represent value for money, be financially viable and delivered through financially sustainable institutions
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        that institutions taking on existing institutions or provision, and some or all of the related assets, will take on all, or an appropriate share, of the associated costs and liabilities
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        that the Secretary of State has no obligation to assume, discharge or provide funding for the liabilities of an institution which is dissolving or in financial difficult, but might decide to do so in particular cases, to protect students or secure outcomes, or otherwise in the public interest
