      We have streamlined the process this year in consultation with key provider associations and this will reduce the number of separate documents we will send to institutions during January and February 2017.

         The starting point is the number of valid students with a census date of 1 November 2016 based on R04 for 2016 to 2017. This is multiplied by the ratio of 1 November to all-year student numbers based on the R04 return for 2015 to 2016 and the final R14 return for that year. We will also compare this figure with the student numbers calculated from R06, both the year-to-date (as at 1 February) figure and the number recruited by 1 November. Where there is a significant increase or decrease in student numbers we may revise the allocation accordingly. This could result in a delay to issuing allocations for institutions involved

         The approach is similar to that for 2016 to 2017 allocations, that is, depending on the profile of recruitment for the individual provider we either use a 12 month rolling figure for February 2016 to January 2017 based on R14 (2015 to 2016) and R06 (2016 to 2017) data; or the same approach as set out above for
