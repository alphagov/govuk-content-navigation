      Introduction
     </h2>
     <p>
      This guide provides information to all those involved in the delivery of the Care to Learn scheme in the 2015 to 2016 academic year.  It provides general information about the eligibility criteria for the scheme which has been set by the Education Funding Agency (EFA).
     </p>
     <p>
      This guide does not attempt to offer definitive advice for every situation; stakeholders who require further or more detailed help and advice should contact the Student Bursary Support Service who administer the scheme on behalf of the EFA.  The sources of further information section provides useful telephone numbers; e-mail and website addresses.
     </p>
     <h2 id="a-summary-of-care-to-learn-in-the-2015-to-2016-academic-year">
      A summary of Care to Learn in the 2015 to 2016 academic year
     </h2>
     <p>
      Care to Learn is intended to help enable young parents under the age of 20 to continue in, and return to education after the birth of a child by providing funding for childcare whilst the young parent is engaged in a study programme and is therefore not able to provide care for their child.  Care to Learn can also assist with the cost of associated travel costs.  The scheme can provide up to a maximum total amount of support of £160 per child per week or up to a maximum of £175 per child per week in London.
     </p>
     <p>
      The young parent’s study programme must have some public funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Care to Learn will only fund childcare provision that is registered with Ofsted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Young parents, their education institution and their childcare provider must all meet the eligibility criteria to receive Care to Learn.
     </p>
     <p>
      Young parents must complete and submit a new application for each academic year they want to claim Care to Learn funding, even if their study programme runs for more than one year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Young parents are encouraged to apply for Care to Learn before the start of their study programme or as soon as possible after they start.  It is important that young parents are aware that payments can only be backdated to the start of their study programme if their application is received within 28 days of the start date.  Payments for any applications received outside of this timeframe will begin from the Monday of the week in which the application was received. Young parents can apply before their baby is born, but their application cannot be fully assessed until all the child’s details have been provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stakeholders are encouraged to tell young parents about the availability of financial support for childcare through Care to Learn to help them make more informed decisions about their options.
     </p>
     <h2 id="care-to-learn-eligibility">
      Care to Learn eligibility
     </h2>
     <p>
      In order to receive support from Care to Learn, the young parent, their education institution and childcare provider must all meet the eligibility criteria for the scheme as set out below.
     </p>
     <h3 id="age">
      Age
     </h3>
     <p>
      The young parent must be aged under 20 years old on the date they start their study programme.  Young parents who become 20 during their study programme will continue to be funded to the end of that specific study programme, ie to the end of the same programme at the same level.
     </p>
     <h3 id="main-carer-for-the-children">
      Main carer for the child(ren)
     </h3>
     <p>
      The young parent must be the main carer and in receipt of Child Benefit for the child(ren) for whom they are claiming Care to Learn.  If a young parent loses custody of their child(ren), even temporarily, the Student Bursary Support Service must be told immediately.  Care to Learn may be claimed by the mother or the father of the child as long as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the other parent is unable to provide childcare, eg: they are also in education or are absent; and
      </li>
      <li>
       the other parent is not claiming childcare paid through Tax Credits
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="living-and-studying-in-england">
      Living and studying in England
     </h3>
     <p>
      Only young parents who are both living and studying in England are eligible for Care to Learn.
     </p>
     <p>
      A London weighting applies to the scheme.  The London weighted maximum is £175 per child per week (compared with a maximum of £160 outside London).  Eligibility for London weighting is determined by the young parent’s home address and applies to the following Boroughs:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Barking &amp; Dagenham, Barnet, Bexley, Brent, Bromley, Camden, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Greenwich, Hackney &amp; City of London, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham, Haringey, Harrow, Havering, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Islington, Kensington &amp; Chelsea, Kingston-upon-Thames, Lambeth, Lewisham, Merton, Newham, Redbridge, Richmond-upon-Thames, Southwark, Sutton, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Wandsworth and Westminster
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="residency">
      Residency
     </h3>
     <p>
      To be eligible for Care to Learn, a young parent must meet the following residency criteria:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       be a British citizen; or
      </li>
      <li>
       a national of a country within the European Economic Area (EEA) or the child of a Swiss national or Turkish migrant worker
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Where a young parent indicates that they are a migrant from a country that is outside the EEA, they will only be eligible for Care to Learn if one of the following immigration conditions applies:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       they are an asylum seeker aged under 18
      </li>
      <li>
       they are an asylum seeker aged 18 or over only if they are a care leaver aged 18 or 19; if they are they must send an original letter from their local authority that shows their address and confirms they are a care leaver with their application
      </li>
      <li>
       they have refugee status
      </li>
      <li>
       they have humanitarian protection
      </li>
      <li>
       they have discretionary leave
      </li>
      <li>
       they have indefinite leave to remain
      </li>
      <li>
       they have indefinite leave to enter
      </li>
      <li>
       they have limited leave to remain
      </li>
      <li>
       they have limited leave to enter
      </li>
      <li>
       they have leave outside the rules
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Young parents are not required to submit evidence of their residency status with their application.  However, where they confirm they are a migrant from outside the EEA, the EFA may request evidence and/or may carry out checks with the Home Office to confirm their immigration status.  Supporting evidence may be requested from the young parent if any issues are identified.
     </p>
     <h3 id="education-institution-and-the-study-programme">
      Education institution and the study programme
     </h3>
     <p>
      The young parent’s study programme must have some public funding. However there are no specific requirements for the length, duration or level of the study programme.  The following therefore gives examples of study programmes which are eligible for Care to Learn and is not an exhaustive list:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       school and college study programmes including 14 to 19 diplomas, GCSEs, A levels
      </li>
      <li>
       non accredited day sessions and short programmes within the community such as first aid, healthy eating, parenting etc
      </li>
      <li>
       traineeships for young people not currently in a job/who have little work experience but whom providers and employers believe have a reasonable chance of being ready for employment or an apprenticeship within six months
      </li>
      <li>
       further education (FE) study programmes in a higher education (HE) institution including access courses and diplomas
      </li>
      <li>
       foundation HE courses where they are followed at an FE institution, eg: BTEC diploma
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      However, it is important to note that the following are not eligible for Care to Learn:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       privately funded education, for example, at an independent school or other institution where students are required to pay tuition fees
      </li>
      <li>
       voluntary work that is not a required part of an agreed study programme
      </li>
      <li>
       apprenticeships, because apprentices are paid by their employer
      </li>
      <li>
       HE courses in an HE institution or FE institution, including courses leading to a first degree, HND, HNC, diploma in HE, foundation degree or initial teacher training
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      In any instances where a young parent is still looking after their child, for example, whilst they are undertaking a study programme with a childcare provider, this is outside the scope of Care to Learn funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Young parents can apply before the date of their study programme has been finalised; however the application cannot be fully assessed until the study programme details are confirmed.
     </p>
     <h3 id="study-time-and-work-experience-placements">
      Study time and work experience placements
     </h3>
     <p>
      Young parents can claim Care to Learn for independent study time which is required as part of their study programme, eg to complete coursework, undertake revision or homework.  The amount of independent study time which is required must be agreed between the young parent and their education institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      Care to Learn will support time needed to undertake work experience placements, but only where these have been clearly identified as an integral part of the study programme
     </p>
     <p>
      The costs associated with independent study time and work experience placements will form part of the Care to Learn weekly maximum amount (£160 per child per week and £175 per child per week in London).
     </p>
     <h3 id="childcare-provision">
      Childcare provision
     </h3>
     <p>
      Childcare provision must be registered with Ofsted for it to be eligible for Care to Learn funding.  It must be registered in one of the following ways:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       on the early years register with either Ofsted or a childminder agency
      </li>
      <li>
       on the compulsory and/or voluntary part of the general childcare register with either Ofsted or a childminder agency
      </li>
      <li>
       offered by Ofsted registered schools, ie: breakfast and after school clubs and holiday care
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Support for specialist provision on the Care Quality Commission’s register may also be granted on a case by case basis if general childcare provision is not suitable for the child.
     </p>
     <p>
      The childcare provider must provide evidence of being registered with Ofsted, or, in the case of a school providing childcare, their unique reference number (URN). From 1 September 2014 childminder agencies have been able to register with Ofsted on behalf of the childminders they represent; childminder agencies will be required to provide evidence of their Ofsted registration.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a childcare provider is related to the child, the childcare provider must, in addition to being registered with Ofsted:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       live apart from the child; and
      </li>
      <li>
       be providing registered childcare services for other children to whom they are not related.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="other-sources-of-childcare-support-and-care-to-learn">
      Other sources of childcare support and Care to Learn
     </h3>
     <p>
      Local authorities have a duty to secure 570 hours a year of government funded early education over no fewer than 38 weeks of the year for all three and four-year-olds and eligible two-year-olds.  Children become eligible for a government funded early education place from 1 September, 1 January or 1 April following their second or third birthday.
     </p>
     <p>
      A two-year-old child is eligible for an early education place if their parent(s) claims any one of the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Income Support
      </li>
      <li>
       Income-based Jobseekers Allowance
      </li>
      <li>
       Income-related Employment and Support Allowance
      </li>
      <li>
       support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999
      </li>
      <li>
       the guaranteed element of State Pension Credit
      </li>
      <li>
       Child  or Working Tax Credits and have an annual gross household  income of no more than £16,190
      </li>
      <li>
       Working Tax Credit Run-on – paid for 4 weeks after the claimant stops qualifying for Working Tax Credit
      </li>
      <li>
       Universal Credit
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A two-year-old child is also eligible if they:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       are looked after by the local authority
      </li>
      <li>
       have a current statement of special education needs (SEN) or an education, health and care plan (EHCP)
      </li>
      <li>
       receives a Disability Living Allowance
      </li>
      <li>
       have left care through special guardianship or an adoption or child arrangements order
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Two-year old children who meet the eligibility criteria can continue to receive a funded place once they have taken it up, even if their circumstances change at a later date. To find out more about the entitlement to early learning for 2-year olds and to see if their child is eligible for a place, parents should visit
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/free-early-education">
       freechildcare
      </a>
      on GOV.UK.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is expected that young parents should access this entitlement before applying for funding from Care to Learn. Young parents may apply for Care to Learn for support to cover any extra hours (over and above their funded early education entitlement) to complete their study programme.  This point is explicitly referenced in the declaration on the application.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local authorities will be able to provide further information about government funded early education in their area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Childcare Tax Credits are also available for parents (lone or couples) who meet the eligibility criteria to provide help with childcare costs.  Any childcare hours being requested for Care to Learn payments must not already be being funded from Child Tax Credits.  Again, this point is explicitly referenced in the declaration on the application.
     </p>
     <h2 id="the-care-to-learn-application-process">
      The Care to Learn application process
     </h2>
     <p>
      In the 2015 to 2016 academic year, the application process for Care to Learn is moving to an online approach. Guidance will be available throughout the online process to help young parents complete their application.
     </p>
     <p>
      Student Bursary Support Service (SBSS) portal accounts have already been set up for young parents who received support from Care to Learn in the 2014 to 2015 academic year. Emails have been sent to these young parents providing further details on how to access the online portal. A temporary password has also been sent out to them separately by post. If they require continuing support from Care to Learn in the 2015 to 2016 academic year, they must log in to the portal using the information provided and complete a new application. The first time they log in they will be prompted to change the temporary password to one that is private and more memorable. Once logged in, they should follow the instructions to complete the online application.
     </p>
     <p>
      New Care to Learn applicants need to apply
      <a href="https://studentbursarysupport.education.gov.uk/OnlineApplication/Introduction.aspx" rel="external">
       online
      </a>
      and follow the instructions to complete the application.
     </p>
     <p>
      To apply, the young parent will need to know:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       their childcare provider details including contact name, email address and Ofsted registration number (available from the childcare provider or found at
       <a href="http://reports.Ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">
        ofsted reports
       </a>
      </li>
      <li>
       details for their chosen education institution including contact name, email address and phone number
      </li>
      <li>
       details of any additional travel costs they may wish to claim
      </li>
      <li>
       name, address, email address and contact details of their support worker (if they have one)
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If a young parent does not have all the information to hand to complete the online application in full, it can be saved at any time. When they have the required information, they can log back in to the portal and resume their online application.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once the online application has been completed in full, young parents will need to ensure that they have read and agree to the privacy notice and declaration before they submit it.
     </p>
     <p>
      On submission, young parents will receive an email to confirm their application has been received.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Student Bursary Support Service will make contact with the young parent’s chosen childcare provider and education institution and ask them to provide further details to confirm the course or study programme details and the childcare requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The young parent’s application cannot be processed until all parties have completed their part of the application process.
     </p>
     <p>
      Existing Care to Learn childcare providers and education institutions should have received an email from the Student Bursary Support Service providing further details on how to access the online portal. A temporary password has also been sent out to them separately by post. Once logged in, they should follow the instructions to complete their respective parts of the application.

      New Care to Learn childcare providers and education institutions will be contacted by the Student Bursary Support Service to verify their eligibility for Care to Learn. The Student Bursary Support Service will then register them on the portal and send them details on how to access it. Once logged in, they should follow the instructions to complete their respective parts of the application.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is important that all parties: young parent, education institution and childcare provider are fully aware of the content of the relevant declarations before submitting their part of the application.
     </p>
     <div class="call-to-action">

      Assessment of the application

     <p>
      The Student Bursary Support Service will carry out an assessment of the young parent’s application to determine their eligibility for Care to Learn. These checks will ensure the childcare provider, education institution and study programme are eligible for the scheme, and that the childcare hours claimed are reasonable in comparison with the hours entered for the study programme.
     </p>

      <p>
       Care to Learn payments cannot be made until all information from the young parent, education institution and childcare provider has been received and approved and a payment plan has been issued. It is particularly important that childcare providers are fully aware of this.
      </p>
     </div>

        <li>
         if the student started a two year NVQ programme (at the same level) on 2 September 2014 which ends on 17 July 2016 these dates should be entered
        </li>
        <li>
         if the student studied at Level 1 last year and is progressing to Level 2 this year, even if this is in the same subject, this is considered to be a new study programme and the dates for the new study programme only should be entered

      Confirmation of eligibility
     </h3>
     <p>
      Once the application has been processed and approved, the Student Bursary Support Service will send an email confirming Care to Learn eligibility to the young parent, childcare provider and education institution (if appropriate). The Student Bursary Support Service will issue a payment plan which confirms the amount that will be paid each week for childcare and the dates between which childcare costs will be paid.  Where the young parent intends to use more than one childcare provider, a payment plan will be issued to each childcare provider. The combined amounts on each plan will not exceed the Care to Learn weekly maximum amount (up to £160 per child per week or up to £175 per child per week in London). All payment plans and correspondence can be viewed on the SBSS portal accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Student Bursary Support Service will also confirm that eligibility for Care to Learn covers the whole or remainder of the academic year, enabling the young parent to complete one study programme and embark on a new one within the same academic year without being required to submit a new application (as long as the eligibility criteria continue to be met).  However, any changes must be notified to the Student Bursary Support Service via a change of circumstances process available on the portal as any changes may impact on the dates and costs set out in the payment plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Student Bursary Support Service will also confirm the amount to be paid for additional travel costs, if applicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the young parent is not eligible for Care to Learn, the Student Bursary Support Service will send a refusal email to explain this. A copy will also be sent to their support worker if their details have been provided on the application.

If the application is received after the 28 day period, payments will begin only from the Monday of the week the application was received by the Student Bursary Support Service.

      Care to Learn will pay towards the cost of childcare up to a maximum of £160 per child per week (up to a maximum of £175 per child per week if the young parent’s home address attracts London weighting). The funds will be paid directly to the childcare provider or childminder agency each month in advance.   Childcare providers must note that no Care to Learn payments can be made until all the information required from the young parent, education institution and childcare provider has been received by the Student Bursary Support Service.

      Deposits of up to £250 per child can be paid to the childcare provider if required. The amount of deposit will be deducted from the first month’s childcare payment. In the unlikely event that the first month’s childcare payment is insufficient to support the deduction of the full deposit, the balance will be deducted from the second month’s childcare payment. The childcare provider cannot have the deposit offset against the final weeks of the payment plan.

      Young parents may claim for travel costs that are necessary to take their child(ren) between childcare and home where those costs are in addition to their normal travel costs from home to college.  Travel costs will not be paid where the childcare takes place on the same site as the education.  The total of the childcare and travel costs must not exceed the weekly maximum amount of £160 per child per week (or up to £175 per child per week in London).
     </p>
     <p>
      If the amount of travel being requested seems excessive, the Student Bursary Support Service will request additional information from the education institution to confirm that the costs are reasonable, based on their local knowledge.
     </p>
     <p>
      Travel payments are made to the education institution.  The education institution should reimburse the travel payment to the young parent, or use it to arrange transport for the young parent, as appropriate.

      A one off £100 childminder network/broker payment will be made for each application which is supported by a network/broker or childminder agency, if they are acting in the capacity set out below, that results in a young parent starting their chosen study programme. This is dependent on that network/broker or childminder agency providing at least three of the five services listed below:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       brokerage, in terms of providing a list of available childminders. This would also involve using knowledge of the childminder and their arrangements to explain alternative provision to the young person
      </li>
      <li>
       matching, to help the young parent identify a suitable childminder who meets their needs and is convenient for travel, for example. This may involve visits and discussions
      </li>
      <li>
       agreeing terms and conditions for the childminding that meet the young parent’s needs. These would go beyond price alone and include issues such as timing, drop off and collection, diet, routine and behavioural issues. It may also extend to agreeing flexibilities for study, vacations, deposits, retainers, for example. This will ideally be set out in a formal written agreement
      </li>
      <li>
       using briefings, arranging training and working with childcare providers to meet the needs of young parents
      </li>
      <li>
       retaining an ongoing interest in the young parent for the duration of the course and assisting where possible in any change of arrangements
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      In addition, the network/broker or agency must be recognised by their local authority, Early Years Development and Childcare Partnership, or Family Information Service, or the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The childcare provider is asked on the Care to Learn application to make a formal declaration about whether they have been supported by a childminding network/broker or a childminder agency acting in this capacity.

      Attendance monitoring

     <p>
      Payments for childcare will only be made while the young parent is still attending their study programme and the child is still in childcare. Both the education institution and childcare provider are required to complete monthly attendance monitoring returns online via the Student Bursary Support Service portal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Attendance monitoring returns should be completed online and submitted to the Student Bursary Support Service within 7 working days of becoming available via the portal in order to avoid payments being withheld. An email will be sent to education institutions and childcare providers when the attendance monitoring returns are available.
     </p>
     <p>
      Young parents and their child(ren) are expected to attend their respective provision for all the hours stated in the application, but there may be occasions where this is not possible, for example, because of illness or family emergency. For that reason, there is no required level of attendance set for Care to Learn.  Education institutions should use their discretion to assess whether a young parent is still attending their study programme, considering the number of and reasons for absences to decide whether or not reasonable attendance has been met.
     </p>
     <p>
      Failure by education institutions or childcare providers to complete and submit attendance monitoring returns within 7 working days will result in childcare and travel payments being withheld.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education institutions and childcare providers should notify the Student Bursary Support Service immediately if the young parent has stopped attending their study programme or has removed their child from childcare.
