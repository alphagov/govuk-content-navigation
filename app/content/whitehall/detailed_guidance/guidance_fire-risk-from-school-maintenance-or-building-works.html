    Supporting schools to manage fire risks when undertaking construction or maintenance activities involving hot works such as roof repairs

       Any construction activity involving hot works has the potential to cause a serious fire, therefore they should only be undertaken when all other options have been considered first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fire can be a particular hazard in refurbishment and maintenance work when there is a lot of dry timber or other flammable materials present.
