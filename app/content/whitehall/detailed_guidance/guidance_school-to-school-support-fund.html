      </abbr>
      can apply for grants to provide support that meets the criteria below.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a school offering support, you should be either a:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       designated national support school, committed to supporting other schools to raise standards
      </li>
      <li>
       designated teaching school with capacity to co-ordinate and oversee high quality support to a number of schools, through a number of system leaders
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Schools receiving support should:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       be a maintained school judged by Ofsted as requires improvement or an academy judged as requires improvement or inadequate (applications to support maintained schools and academies with different Ofsted judgements will be considered in exceptional circumstances)
      </li>
      <li>
       be open to receiving support from an
       <abbr title="national leader of education">
        NLE
       </abbr>
       or teaching school to help improve school performance
      </li>
      <li>
       not be receiving funding from other sources for similar school improvement purposes, such as funding from an academy sponsor or grants for academy conversion.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      In order to identify schools that will benefit most from receiving support, you should discuss your potential applications with:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       regional schools commissioners
