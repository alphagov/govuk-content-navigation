      Organisations that are eligible for funding from the SFA are listed on the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-training-organisations">
       register of training organisations
      </a>
      . These organisations can be invited to bid for contracts with the SFA, but appearing on the register doesn’t guarantee you will receive funding or a contract with the SFA.
     </p>
     <p>
      To register and bid for education and skills funding, you must have a UK Provider Registration Number (UKPRN). You can get a UKPRN from the
      <a href="http://www.ukrlp.co.uk/" rel="external">
       UK Register of Learning Providers (UKRLP)
      </a>
      . The UKPRN allows you to register on the
      <a href="https://skillsfundingagency.bravosolution.co.uk/" rel="external">
       SFA e-tendering portal (Bravo)
      </a>
      to bid for contracts after completing the entry qualification process.
     </p>
     <p>
      Organisations must complete our
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sfa-register-of-training-organisations">
       entry qualification process
      </a>
      in order to enter the register, which is open at select points during the year. Once completed eligible organisations can be entered on the register of training organisations.
