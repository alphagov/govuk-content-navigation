       To offer government funded education and skills training such as apprenticeships you must be listed on one of the SFA’s registers. Depending on the type of training you want to provide you can apply to be on:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers">

        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       To register and bid for education and skills funding, you must have a UK Provider Registration Number (UKPRN) from the
       <a href="http://www.ukrlp.co.uk/" rel="external">
        UK Register of Learning Providers (UKRLP)
       </a>

        SFA e-tendering portal (Bravo)
       </a>
       to bid for contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will inform existing and aspiring providers when both registers are open for new applications through our weekly

       Signing agreements and contracts with the SFA
      </h2>
      <p>
       If your application to the SFA is successful, you will need to sign either a:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         contract for service with the SFA to provide adult education or apprenticeship training to non-levy paying employers

       SFA contracts and apprenticeship agreements are issued through the
       <a href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">
        Skills Funding Service (SFS)
       </a>
       . We need to ensure that we have a method in place that allows the secure transfer of sensitive information. We use our Information Management Services (IDAMS) for this purpose and each provider needs a super-user who can assign a range of different roles. You can find out more in the

      <p>
       If you are providing apprenticeship training, you’ll need to have a contract with the employer setting out the terms and conditions of your training offer. The SFA does not need to see this, although our audit process will check that the contract is in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Levy-paying employers will use the apprenticeship service to manage funding with you. The employer will add the name and UKPRN of their selected provider in their digital account along with the agreed cost of training and assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will need to confirm some information about the apprentices and the training that you are providing in the apprenticeship service.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both you and the employer will need to confirm that this information is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       The employer may want you to enter details of the apprentices for them on the apprenticeship service. You will be able to do this on screen or through a data upload. The SFA will check this information against your ILR data before payments are made.

      <p>
       You must contract with the apprentice assessment organisation that has been selected by the employer. You must have a written agreement in place with this assessment organisation and make payment to them for conducting the end-point assessment. The written agreement must set out the arrangements for end-point assessment, including arrangements for any re-takes and payments. You can find further details in the
