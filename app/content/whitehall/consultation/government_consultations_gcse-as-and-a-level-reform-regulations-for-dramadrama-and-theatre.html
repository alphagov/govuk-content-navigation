      We have decided to adopt some of our proposed rules and guidance for reformed GCSEs in drama, and reformed AS and A levels in drama and theatre.
     </p>
     <p>
      We have also made a number of changes to reflect concerns raised in response to our consultation. In particular, we have:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       removed the requirement for exam boards to set tasks for devised performances
      </li>
      <li>
       given exam boards more flexibility around how they structure their non-exam assessment
      </li>
      <li>
       removed some other unnecessary constraints on the design of assessments
      </li>
      <li>
       revised our guidance on the term ‘complete and substantial performance text’ at GCSE to include texts typically longer than 45 minutes when performed
      </li>
      <li>
       changed our proposed approach to marking of non-exam assessment
      </li>
     </ul>

      We have already published final versions of our:

      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
       require students to participate in at least two performances - a devised performance and a text-based performance - only one of which can be a monologue
      </li>

      This consultation is about the rules and guidance we plan to put in place for new GCSEs in drama, and new AS and A levels in drama and theatre. These rules will apply to the exam boards that want to offer new drama GCSEs and new drama and theatre AS and A levels from September 2016.
