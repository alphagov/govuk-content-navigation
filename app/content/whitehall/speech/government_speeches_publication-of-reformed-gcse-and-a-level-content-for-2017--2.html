        that was published in January 2015. Like the full course, demand has increased with a greater emphasis on theory and use of data. Students will also have the opportunity to develop and demonstrate practical skills and will be assessed in one team and one individual sport/activity.

        The more demanding sociology
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        requires students to develop an understanding of the classical theorists and how their ideas have contributed to the development of current sociological orthodoxies. They will compare and contrast competing theoretical approaches to explain society, drawing connections between the different topic areas, and students will now be required to read and respond to extracts from classic and contemporary sociological texts.

        Geology AS and
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced level">
         A level
        </abbr>
        content requires students to take a more quantitative and mathematical approach to the study of geology. New content includes the study of geochemistry, the role of fluids in geology, engineering geology and geohazard risk analysis. Fieldwork remains a key part of the subject, and students will carry out relevant and meaningful fieldwork activities that will be assessed across a full range of practical competencies, developed with
        <abbr title="higher education">
         HE
        </abbr>
        stakeholders, in order to prepare them for further geological study.

        The final content for politics AS and
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced level">
         A level
        </abbr>
        requires all students to understand a fourth political idea, in addition to their study of conservatism, liberalism and socialism. Students will choose from feminism, multiculturalism, anarchism, nationalism or ecologism, and know and understand the core principles and features of these ideas. As part of this they will study the work of a diverse list of political thinkers who have contributed to each idea. Following

         consultation
        </a>
        we have revised the list of political theorists to make sure that female thinkers are appropriately represented. At
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced level">
         A level
        </abbr>
        , students will choose between a comparative study of
        <abbr title="United States of America">

        and
        <abbr title="United Kingdom">

        politics and government, which now includes understanding different approaches to comparative politics, or a study of global politics.

        The reformed statistics AS and
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced level">
         A level
        </abbr>
        requires students to study the statistical enquiry cycle and to perform key statistical calculations such as Bayes’ theorem and 1- and 2-sample non-parametric tests. Students will be required to know and use fundamental formulae, for example to determine the Poisson probability formula and analysis of variance. New content has been added, such as choosing the appropriate hypothesis test to carry out in particular circumstances and calculating the risk of a type II error.
