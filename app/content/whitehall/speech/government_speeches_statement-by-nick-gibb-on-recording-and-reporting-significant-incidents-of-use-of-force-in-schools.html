      On 23 June this year I made a statement announcing that the Secretary of State had asked his expert adviser on behaviour, Charlie Taylor, to review the implications for schools of the requirement to record and report the use of force in schools, and that, subject to the outcome of that review, it was our intention to commence this requirement on 1 September 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the light of the results of this review, the Secretary of State has decided not to commence this requirement and will seek to repeal it at the first suitable legislative opportunity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Copies of Charlie Taylor’s Report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
