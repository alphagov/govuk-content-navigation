         24th report of the School Teachers’ Review Body (
         <abbr title="School Teachers’ Review Body">
          STRB
         </abbr>
         )
        </a>
        is being published today, responding to the remit I issued in October 2013. The report contains recommendations on how to apply the pay award for teachers that is due to be implemented from September 2014. Subject to the views of consultees, I intend to accept the
        <abbr title="School Teachers’ Review Body">
         STRB
        </abbr>
        ’s recommendations in full.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <abbr title="School Teachers’ Review Body">
         STRB
        </abbr>
        has recommended a 1% uplift of the national framework for teachers’ pay from September 2014. The uplift will be applied to the minima and maxima of all the pay ranges and allowances in the national pay framework, including the:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         unqualified teachers’ pay range
        </li>
        <li>
         main pay range
        </li>
        <li>
         upper pay range
        </li>
        <li>
         leading practitioner pay range
        </li>
        <li>
         leadership pay range
        </li>
        <li>
         headteacher groups
        </li>
        <li>
         teaching and learning responsibility (
         <abbr title="teaching and learning responsibility">
          TLR
         </abbr>
         ) allowance pay ranges
        </li>
        <li>
         special educational needs (
         <abbr title="special educational needs">
          SEN
         </abbr>
         ) allowance pay range
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The
        <abbr title="School Teachers’ Review Body">
         STRB
        </abbr>
        has also recommended that those teachers and school leaders who currently sit on the maxima of the pay ranges should receive a 1% uplift. For all teachers who are paid other than on the minima and maxima the
        <abbr title="School Teachers’ Review Body">
         STRB
        </abbr>
        has recommended that schools should determine locally how to take account of the uplift.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the uplift, the
        <abbr title="School Teachers’ Review Body">
         STRB
        </abbr>
        has made a number of recommendations about advice that my department should issue, including that the discretionary reference points in departmental advice should be uplifted by 1%. A full list of the recommendations is attached as an annex.
       </p>
       <p>
        My officials will write to all of the statutory consultees of the
        <abbr title="School Teachers’ Review Body">
         STRB
        </abbr>
        to invite them to contribute to a consultation on my acceptance of these recommendations, and on the text of the 2014 School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document. The consultation will last for 6 weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am grateful for the careful consideration which the
        <abbr title="School Teachers’ Review Body">
         STRB
        </abbr>
        has given to this important matter. Copies of the

       <ol>
        <li>
         In October 2013, I referred to the
         <abbr title="School Teachers’ Review Body">
          STRB
         </abbr>
         the following matters for recommendation:
         <ul>
          <li>
           what adjustments should be made to the salary and allowance ranges and scales for classroom teachers, unqualified teachers and school leaders to reflect the 1% pay award for public sector workers
          </li>
          <li>
           what adjustments should be made to salaries and allowances in payment
          </li>
          <li>
           how to provide a simplified and flexible framework for ensuring school leaders’ pay is appropriate to the challenge of the post and their contribution to their school or schools
          </li>
          <li>
           how the current detailed provisions for allowances, other pay flexibilities and safeguarding could be reformed to allow a simpler and more flexible
           <abbr title="school teachers' pay and conditions document">
            STPCD
           </abbr>
          </li>
          <li>
           how the framework for teachers’ non-pay conditions of service could be reformed to raise the status of the profession and support the recruitment and retention of high-quality teachers, and raise standards of education for all children
          </li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
         In making its recommendations, the
         <abbr title="School Teachers’ Review Body">
          STRB
         </abbr>
         was asked to consider:
         <ul>
          <li>
           the need to ensure that the proposals reflect the government’s policy that public sector pay awards average 1% for the 2 years following the pay freeze
          </li>
          <li>
           the affordability of any recommendations within the existing budgets of individual schools
          </li>
          <li>
           the need to ensure that any proposals are not difficult or onerous for schools to implement
          </li>
          <li>
           evidence of the national state of teacher and school leader supply, including rates of recruitment and retention, vacancy rates and the quality of candidates applying for qualified teacher status (

           evidence of the wider state of the labour market in England and Wales
          </li>
          <li>
           forecast changes in the pupil population and consequent changes in the level of demand for teachers
          </li>
          <li>
           the government’s commitment to increasing autonomy for all headteachers and governing bodies to establish pay arrangements that are suited to the individual circumstances of their schools

         </ul>

         In its 24th report, the
         <abbr title="School Teachers’ Review Body">
          STRB
         </abbr>
         has recommended:
         <ul>
          <li>
           1% uplift to be applied to the minima and maxima of all the pay ranges and allowances in the national pay framework (unqualified teachers’ range, main pay range, upper pay range, leading practitioner pay range and the leadership pay range, including the minima and maxima of the 8 headteacher pay bands, the 3 levels of teaching and learning responsibility (

           ) allowance)
          </li>
          <li>
           that, for those on individual pay ranges, schools determine locally how to take account of the uplift to the national framework in making individual pay progression decisions and consider how individual pay ranges should be uplifted
          </li>
          <li>
           the pay of teachers on the minima and maxima of their range and of headteachers on the minima and maxima of their pay band be uplifted to the new minima and maxima in September 2014
