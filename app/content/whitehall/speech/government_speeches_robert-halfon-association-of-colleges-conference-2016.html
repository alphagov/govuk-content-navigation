       <p>
        Not long ago I was listening to the radio, and a comedian noted that at the entrance to an English town a sign read: “Welcome to this town, home of its college”. They then went on making fun of the town for advertising itself and the college in this way.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is exactly the problem we face in our country. The fact that a town is proud of its college is something that should be celebrated, not ridiculed on prime-time radio.
       </p>
       <p>
        I feel this is the wrong attitude, the wrong way to look at further education. It shows the mountain we face when we try to change the perception of
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        with the wider public.
       </p>
       <p>
        Far from talking down our colleges, we should be celebrating our
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        sector, celebrating our principals, governors, teachers and students. We should be celebrating the fact that
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        colleges can help so many of those on low incomes get the qualifications they need.
       </p>
       <h2 id="harlow-college">
        Harlow College
       </h2>
       <p>
        How do I know this?
       </p>
       <p>
        I’m proud to say that my views have been shaped by my own local college in Harlow over the years since I was elected as their
        <abbr title="member of parliament">
         MP
        </abbr>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been inspired by the staff, been inspired by the students and been inspired by the transformative effect the college has had on the community itself. I believe that colleges are not only beacons of education, but also civic institutions at the heart of our communities. That is why I have visited Harlow College 50 times since 2010, and why I intend to visit many more.
       </p>
       <h2 id="visits-tour">
        Visits tour
       </h2>
       <p>
        In the north-east I visited New College Durham and Derwentside. In the north-west, I toured Blackpool and the Fylde College, and in the east of England I have seen Cambridge Regional College and West Suffolk College.
       </p>
       <h2 id="success-statistics">
        Success statistics
       </h2>
       <p>
        We should be proud: out of 385 colleges 19% are outstanding and 61% are good. But even more significant are the statistics showing the destinations of adult students who complete
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        courses: 64% get jobs, 20% go into further learning and 4% go on to university.
       </p>
       <p>
        None of these results would be possible without the huge work principals and teachers do. Your work and your commitment to improving the life chances of the students are second to none.
       </p>
       <h2 id="unions">
        Unions
       </h2>
       <p>
        I also want to acknowledge the support that trade unions in the sector give, and am pleased to have recently met with
        <abbr title="University and College Union">
         UCU
        </abbr>
        and
        <abbr title="Association of Teachers and Lecturers">
         ATL
        </abbr>
        to hear about their project which is one of a number of projects funded via the Unionlearn Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unionlearn develops the capacity of trade unions and union learning representatives to work with employers, employees and learning providers to encourage greater take-up of learning in the workplace. I am proud that this year the government has invested £12 million in this service, which has reached over 2.25 million learners over the last 10 years.
       </p>
       <h2 id="priorities">
        Priorities
       </h2>
       <p>
        As the new
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        minister, I have 5 priorities for
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        :
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         prestige
        </li>
        <li>
         skills
        </li>
        <li>
         social justice
        </li>
        <li>
         strong leadership and financial stability
        </li>
        <li>
         quality
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Let me deal with each of these challenges in turn.
       </p>
       <h2 id="prestige">
        Prestige
       </h2>
       <p>
        First of all, we need a national conversation about the importance of further education, with businesses, unions, community leaders and authorities at all levels, from Westminster to local councils.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a government, we have promoted the conversation about non-academic paths for young people through the Get In Go Far campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part of promoting this conversation lies in making sure that there is good quality, dedicated careers advice for our young people, which covers all options available.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will raise the prestige of
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        by demonstrating to employers the high standard of skills, knowledge and behaviours that students gain, including through apprenticeships.
       </p>
       <p>
        To fund these apprenticeships we are doubling the amount of cash we are investing in apprenticeships to £2.5 billion by 2020 compared to 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        My challenge is this: how is the sector going to use this opportunity to market itself, and innovate, to respond to the needs of national employers? I want colleges to be thinking big.  In the future
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        should be at the front of the queue - like Derwentside College with its 5,800 apprentices - pitching to be the provider of choice for our employers.
       </p>
       <h2 id="skills-gap">
        Skills gap
       </h2>
       <p>
        Second, we must tackle the skills gap and ensure we make opportunities accessible to all. To do this, we have to be honest about the scale of the problem, which has been getting worse for the past 20 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Around 20% of our long-term productivity gap with Germany is due to lower skills levels. We are the only
        <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">
         OECD
        </abbr>
        country where 16- to 24-year-olds are no better at literacy and numeracy than 55- to 65-year-olds.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2 skills that employers say are indispensable in the workplace are maths and English.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have set a clear expectation that having a good level of maths and English should be the norm.  It’s vital that these young people are given the support that they need to gain a sound grasp of English and maths by age 18 and, if possible, to secure
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
         GCSEs
        </abbr>
        at grade C or above.
       </p>
       <p>
        As such, we should celebrate the significant increase in the numbers of people successfully retaking their maths and English
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
         GCSEs
        </abbr>
        . For example, maths was up from 30,000 before we introduced study programmes, to over 50,000 last summer.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am determined to invest in the resources and capacity needed in
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        to improve maths and English.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have invested £40 million in the
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        workforce since 2013. This has funded professional development for thousands of
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        teachers to help them to improve their teaching of maths and English, as well as providing bursaries to over 870 graduates who are training to teach maths or English in the
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also clear that we need a credible, high-quality option for students for whom
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
         GCSEs
        </abbr>
        are not appropriate or achievable.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is why we are reforming functional skills to make sure that they are genuinely relevant to employers, and consequently have credibility and prestige in the jobs market.
       </p>
       <h2 id="social-justice-and-disadvantage">
        Social justice and disadvantage
       </h2>
       <p>
        Further education is essential for social justice - ensuring that individuals from the lowest income backgrounds get on the ladder of opportunity and benefit from the best education and skills training.  Proof lies in the 41% of level 3
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        students who live in areas of educational disadvantage, of whom 34% progress to higher education.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is why I am proud of successfully campaigning with the
        <abbr title="Association of Colleges">
         AoC
        </abbr>
        and Nic Dakin
        <abbr title="member of parliament">
         MP
        </abbr>
        to introduce free school meals in further education - to support students from the most disadvantaged backgrounds.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that securing an
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        qualification increases an individual’s chances to earn better wages and progress to further learning.  For example, a level 2 qualification boosts earnings by 11% on average.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am strongly committed to providing the funding our disadvantaged students need.  Last year this included around £550 million to help colleges support, attract and retain disadvantaged students.  An additional £180-million bursary fund to help with the costs associated with their education and also support our most vulnerable students should ensure every young person is given the best chance to succeed, including those with disabilities or in care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the challenges of the current economic climate, the 2015 spending review was a good one for the sector. For 16- to 19-year-olds, we protected the national base rate of £4,000 per student for the duration of the parliament, and will ensure there is a place in education or training for every 16- to 19-year-old who wants one.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been impressed by stories that the
        <abbr title="University and College Union">
         UCU
        </abbr>
        are sharing, which demonstrate transformative role
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        can have on people’s lives, and shows how it helps us to achieve social justice.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also guaranteed opportunities for adults in technical education.
       </p>
       <p>
        By 2020, if we include the adult education budget, apprenticeship funding and the advanced learner loans, more funding will be available for supporting adult
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        participation that at any time in England’s history.
       </p>
       <p>
        The destination statistics speak for themselves. Of the adult learners who completed an
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        course 64% get jobs, 24% continue learning.
       </p>
       <h2 id="leadership-and-excellence">
        Leadership and excellence
       </h2>
       <p>
        My fourth priority is leadership and excellence in
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        colleges. I have seen remarkable leadership across the
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        landscape. This is why the majority of colleges around the country are in good financial health, with a minority of around 40 colleges suffering with financial difficulties.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a Star Wars fan, when it comes to leadership, I think we need an ‘attack of the clones’. In other words, how do we replicate, and add to, what is best?  I know that the Education and Training Foundation is doing excellent work on this, as are the Collab Group, the Chartered Institution for Further Education and, of course, the
        <abbr title="Association of Colleges">
         AoC
        </abbr>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        This is what the area reviews are about - not just ensuring we have the right structures in place but also that we are prioritising excellence and leadership across our colleges. I am really happy to see that the colleges involved in the process so far have shown real leadership by owning the reviews with their vision and propositions.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are committed to assist colleges needing major changes, with a £100,000 transition grant and access to a restructuring facility, where needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Strong governance plays a key role in a college’s success too, and we are confident that colleges will be able to maintain their financial resilience in the long term.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, if in the future, should colleges suffer extreme financial difficulties, the Technical and Further Education Bill will provide clarity in the unlikely event of insolvency while protecting students as part of the process.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have a moral duty to students that money is spent on learning, and a responsibility to deliver value for money for taxpayers. The bill has the protection and best interests of students at its heart.  It will also encourage prudent borrowing and lending, making sure that money that would otherwise be spent servicing the debt will be invested in high-quality education and training.
       </p>
       <h2 id="quality">
        Quality
       </h2>
       <p>
        My fifth priority is to work with you to increase the quality of technical education including apprenticeships.  The introduction of the apprenticeship levy and the implementation of the Sainsbury review aim to simplify the existing structures and to provide better quality in technical and professional education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Quality is everything.  It’s no good having millions doing technical education, including apprenticeships, if this isn’t excellent.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Technical and Further Education Bill expands the role of the Institute of Apprenticeships to include technical education, making sure employers shape the technical qualifications as well as the apprenticeship standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know the challenges in introducing major reforms to apprenticeships, skills and further education are considerable.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the rest of this Parliament we will focus on consolidating these big changes so that we can ensure that these reforms are bedded in.
       </p>
       <h2 id="conclusion">
        Conclusion
       </h2>
       <p>
        When we leave this conference, let us all play a part in making Britain the skills nation we need it to be.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that the
        <abbr title="Association of Colleges">
         AoC
        </abbr>
        , with the incredible work that it does, will play a major role in this.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let us go out and celebrate that 80% of colleges that are either good or outstanding, and the learners that having completed
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        courses 64% of students get jobs and 20% continue learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let us celebrate that all age apprenticeship participation has increased to nearly 900,000 apprenticeships in 2015 to 2016, the highest number since records began.
       </p>
       <p>
        And when we achieve this, I hope every town in Britain will have a sign saying: “Welcome to this town, home to our brilliant
        <abbr title="further education">
         FE
        </abbr>
        college”.
