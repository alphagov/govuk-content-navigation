     <p>
      Today I am publishing updated statutory safeguarding guidance for schools and colleges -
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education">
       ‘Keeping children safe in education’
      </a>
      . Effective immediately, it has been sent to all schools and colleges and replaces ‘Safeguarding children and safer recruitment in education (2006)’.
     </p>
     <p>
      ‘Keeping children safe in education’ provides guidance on:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       safeguarding systems, including schools’ child protection policies and the appointment of a designated safeguarding lead
      </li>
      <li>
       the checks necessary to carry out recruitment safely
      </li>
      <li>
       dealing with allegations of abuse made against staff members
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The guidance informs those working in schools and colleges about:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       types of abuse and neglect
      </li>
      <li>
       where to find further information about the signs that a child may be being abused
      </li>
      <li>
       how to refer a child about whom they have concerns
      </li>
      <li>
       signposts them to further, detailed information on specific safeguarding issues including female genital mutilation, child sexual exploitation, cyberbullying, mental health, and radicalisation
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The publication of the new guidance follows a
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/keeping-children-safe-in-education">
       public consultation last year
      </a>
      . I have also brought forward an amendment to the School Staffing Regulations (2009) to enable schools to choose the obligatory safe recruitment training that best suits their particular circumstances.
     </p>
     <p>
      These changes will ensure school and college staff are clear about their statutory responsibilities and able to exercise their professional judgement with confidence in keeping children safe.
     </p>
     <p>
      The new guidance will be available will be available on the government website
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/dfe">
