       <p>
        Today I am publishing updated statutory safeguarding guidance for schools and colleges -
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education">
         ‘Keeping children safe in education’
        </a>
        . Effective immediately, it has been sent to all schools and colleges and replaces ‘Safeguarding children and safer recruitment in education (2006)’.
       </p>
       <p>
        ‘Keeping children safe in education’ provides guidance on:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         safeguarding systems, including schools’ child protection policies and the appointment of a designated safeguarding lead
        </li>
        <li>
         the checks necessary to carry out recruitment safely
        </li>
        <li>
         dealing with allegations of abuse made against staff members
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The guidance informs those working in schools and colleges about:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         types of abuse and neglect
        </li>
        <li>
         where to find further information about the signs that a child may be being abused
        </li>
        <li>
         how to refer a child about whom they have concerns
        </li>
        <li>
         signposts them to further, detailed information on specific safeguarding issues including female genital mutilation, child sexual exploitation, cyberbullying, mental health, and radicalisation
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The publication of the new guidance follows a
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/keeping-children-safe-in-education">
         public consultation last year
        </a>
        . I have also brought forward an amendment to the School Staffing Regulations (2009) to enable schools to choose the obligatory safe recruitment training that best suits their particular circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        These changes will ensure school and college staff are clear about their statutory responsibilities and able to exercise their professional judgement with confidence in keeping children safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new guidance will be available will be available on the government website
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/dfe">
         www.gov.uk
        </a>
        .
