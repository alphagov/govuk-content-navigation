       <p>
        Too many academies are paying significantly higher Local Government Pension Scheme (
        <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">
         LGPS
        </abbr>
        ) employer contributions than they did as local authority maintained schools. This is having a detrimental impact on academy budgets; reducing the level of funding available for school improvement and in some cases preventing schools from converting to academies.
       </p>
       <p>
        <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">
         LGPS
        </abbr>
        administering authorities have told us that they view academies as higher risk, as they no longer have the financial backing of the local authority. They have asked that we provide a guarantee that the department will meet any pension liabilities should an academy close. I can inform the House today that we will provide such a guarantee and a
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-and-local-government-pension-scheme-liabilities">
         parliamentary minute
        </a>
        , which sets out the detail of the guarantee, has been laid in both Houses.
       </p>
       <p>
        We now expect all administering authorities to review academy risk assessments and to treat academies equitably when setting employer contribution rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition,
        <abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government">
         DCLG
        </abbr>
        will be launching a consultation on proposals to amend Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations requiring administering authorities to pool academies should they wish to do so. I would encourage both academies and administering authorities to take part in this exercise.
