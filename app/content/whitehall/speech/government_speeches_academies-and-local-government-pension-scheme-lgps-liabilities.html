      Too many academies are paying significantly higher Local Government Pension Scheme (
      <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">
       LGPS
      </abbr>
      ) employer contributions than they did as local authority maintained schools. This is having a detrimental impact on academy budgets; reducing the level of funding available for school improvement and in some cases preventing schools from converting to academies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">
       LGPS
      </abbr>
      administering authorities have told us that they view academies as higher risk, as they no longer have the financial backing of the local authority. They have asked that we provide a guarantee that the department will meet any pension liabilities should an academy close. I can inform the House today that we will provide such a guarantee and a
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-and-local-government-pension-scheme-liabilities">
       parliamentary minute
      </a>
      , which sets out the detail of the guarantee, has been laid in both Houses.
     </p>
     <p>
      We now expect all administering authorities to review academy risk assessments and to treat academies equitably when setting employer contribution rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition,
      <abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government">
       DCLG
      </abbr>
      will be launching a consultation on proposals to amend Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations requiring administering authorities to pool academies should they wish to do so. I would encourage both academies and administering authorities to take part in this exercise.
