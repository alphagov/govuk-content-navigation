      The 22nd report of the School Teachers’ Review Body (
      <abbr title="School Teachers' Review Body">
       STRB
      </abbr>
      ) is being published today. The report contains recommendations on how to apply the pay award that is due to be implemented from September 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      I am grateful for the careful consideration which the
      <abbr title="School Teachers' Review Body">
       STRB
      </abbr>
      has given to this important matter. Copies of the
      <abbr title="School Teachers' Review Body">
       STRB
      </abbr>
      ’s 22nd report are available in the Vote Office, the Printed Paper Office and the Libraries of the House, and online at
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-teachers-review-body-twenty-second-report-2013">

     <p>
      The
      <abbr title="School Teachers' Review Body">
       STRB
      </abbr>
      has recommended that a 1% pay award should be applied equally to all salaries and allowances in payment, and to all points on the pay-scales contained in the School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD). This includes an increase of 1% from September 2013 in the values of:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        all points on the unqualified, main and upper pay scales for classroom teachers
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        the minimum and maximum of the pay range for leading practitioners and all pay ranges for individual posts set before taking account of the September 2013 uplift
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        all points on the leadership pay spine
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        any individual allowances in payment and to the minima and the maxima of the ranges for all teacher allowances.
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      I am grateful to the
      <abbr title="School Teachers' Review Body">
       STRB
      </abbr>
      for these recommendations and, subject to the views of consultees, I intend to accept them in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      My officials will shortly write to all of the statutory consultees of the
      <abbr title="School Teachers' Review Body">
       STRB
      </abbr>
      to invite them to contribute to a consultation on my acceptance of these recommendations, and on the text of the 2013 STPCD. The consultation will last for 4 weeks.
