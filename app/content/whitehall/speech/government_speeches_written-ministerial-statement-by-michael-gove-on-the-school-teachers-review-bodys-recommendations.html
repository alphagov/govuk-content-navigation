        The School Teachers’ Review Body’s (STRB) recommendations on pay for those unqualified teachers who earn a full-time equivalent salary of £21,000 or less are being published today. The recommendations cover the first of two matters which were referred to the STRB in October 2010. I am grateful for the careful consideration which the STRB has given to this matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Copies of the STRB’s analysis and recommendations are available in the Vote Office, the Printed Paper Office and the Libraries of the House and
        <a href="http://www.ome.uk.com/" rel="external">
         from the Office of Manpower Economics
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The STRB has recommended that a non-consolidated payment of £250 should be made to those unqualified teachers who earn £21,000 or less; that the £250 is pro-rated for part-time unqualified teachers; and that consultation should seek to identify a simple and cost-effective method of payment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am grateful to the STRB for these recommendations which will apply to those unqualified teachers on scale points 1 to 3 and subject to consultees’ views, I intend to accept these recommendations.
       </p>
       <p>
        My detailed response contains further information on these issues.

        Annex to Written Ministerial Statement of 21 March 2011:
       </h2>
       <p>
        School Teachers’ Review Body’s (STRB’s) recommendations on pay for those unqualified teachers who earn a full-time equivalent salary of £21,000 or less and response from the Secretary of State for Education (Michael Gove).
       </p>
       <p>
        [The following sets out the STRB’s recommendations which were published on 21 March 2011, together with the response from the Secretary of State for Education. The STRB’s recommendations below are in bold.]
       </p>
       <p>
        The Secretary of State for Education (Michael Gove): The STRB’s analysis and recommendations on pay for those unqualified teachers who earn a full-time equivalent salary of £21,000 or less are being published today. The recommendations cover the first matter which was referred to the STRB in October 2010. Copies of the analysis and recommendations are available in the Vote Office, the Printed Paper Office and the Libraries of the House and
        <a href="http://www.ome.uk.com/" rel="external">
         from the Office of Manpower Economics
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In making its recommendations, the STRB was required to have regard to items a-e set out in the remit letter of 27 October 2010. The recommendations apply to those unqualified teachers earning £21,000 or less in the context of the two-year public sector pay freeze that will affect teachers from September 2011; and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury’s instruction that there should be a minimum award of £250 in each of these two years. I am grateful for the careful attention the STRB has given to this matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        The STRB is due to submit its 20th Report, which will include the recommendations set out below as well as recommendations on whether there should be a limit on the value of discretions that can be applied to head teachers’ pay, by 30 March. I propose, therefore, that the statutory consultation on the STRB’s recommendations (below) should wait until the 20th Report and my response to that report are published in due course. I will, however, accept comments in the meantime on the pay recommendations for unqualified teachers earning £21,000 or less.

        Recommendations on pay for unqualified teachers earning £21,000 or less
       </h2>
       <p>
        The STRB has recommended that:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         A non-consolidated payment of £250 be made in both years to all full-time teachers on spine points 1-3 of the Unqualified Teachers’ scale;
        </li>
        <li>
         The £250 payment be pro-rated according to their working hours for part-time teachers on points 1-3 of the Unqualified Teachers’ scale;
        </li>
        <li>
         The Department consult, with a view to identifying a simple and cost-effective method of payment, and issue guidance as appropriate.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        I am grateful to the STRB for its consideration of this issue and, subject to consultees’ views, I intend to implement the payment from September 2011. I also intend, subject to consultees’ views, for the school’s relevant body to decide how the £250 payment should be implemented.
