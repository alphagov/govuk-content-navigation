      The Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove today laid before the House of Commons a written ministerial statement on education spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Government has today announced a two year pay freeze for all public sector workforces from 2011-12, but remains committed to honouring in full the three-year pay award recommended by the School Teachers’ Review Body.
I can therefore confirm that the teachers’ pay uplift for this year will be implemented from September 2010, marking the last instalment of their three-year pay award.
