      Today marks the start of the tenth annual National Apprenticeship Week (#NAW2017). The week will highlight the success of apprenticeships over the last decade, celebrating the positive impact on individuals, businesses and the economy, with the theme ‘ladder of opportunity’.
     </p>
     <p>
      A launch event held at Barclays Bank on Canary Wharf officially kick-started the week, with Secretary of State for Education, Rt Hon Justine Greening MP addressing an audience of 100 employers and apprentices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary of State highlighted at the launch event, not only the lifetime benefits associated with gaining an apprenticeship, but also how apprenticeships are a gold-standard route into a great career.

     </p>
     <p>
      Also addressing the audience were Chair of the Apprenticeship Delivery Board and the National Apprenticeship Ambassador Network, David Meller and Mike Thompson, Head of Apprenticeships at Barclays.

      Sue Husband, Director, National Apprenticeship Service said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Year-on-year I am overwhelmed by how many organisations get behind National Apprenticeship Week to celebrate the positive impact apprenticeships have on individuals, businesses and the wider economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt that this, our 10th National Apprenticeship Week, will be our biggest and best yet. Today’s launch event has showcased some brilliant apprenticeship success whilst also demonstrating how apprenticeships have benefited both apprentices and employers.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Apprentices are on the path to a great career with an apprenticeship; and for employers, apprenticeships bring opportunity: to attract new talent, to offer progression for current staff, and to develop a motivated and highly qualified workforce. With apprenticeships available in 1500 job roles and covering more than 170 industries – there has never been a better time to get involved in  apprenticeships.
      </p>
