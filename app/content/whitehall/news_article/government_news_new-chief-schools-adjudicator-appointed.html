      The Secretary of State for Education has approved the appointment of Shan Scott as Chief Schools Adjudicator.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Scott has served as an adjudicator for 3 years and brings with her a wide range of educational knowledge and experience.
     </p>
     <p>
      She has been appointed for a 3-year period, with effect from 4 April 2016, and takes over from Dr Elizabeth Passmore, who has retired.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Office of the Schools Adjudicator (OSA) helps to clarify the legal position on admissions policies in schools. Its other responsibilities include settling disputes about school organisation proposals.
     </p>
     <p>
      The schools adjudicators work independently from the Department for Education but are appointed by the Secretary of State for Education.
