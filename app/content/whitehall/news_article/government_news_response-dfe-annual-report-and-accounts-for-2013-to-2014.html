        Responding to the publication of the accounts, a department spokesperson said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         We are pleased the
         <abbr title="National Audit Office">
          NAO
         </abbr>
         has found no material inaccuracies in the financial statements of the department, the
         <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
          EFA
         </abbr>
         and the 3,905 academies included in this report.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, consolidating the accounts of thousands of academies is an enormous task. This is a complex procedure and the largest of its kind carried out in the UK, and involves the consolidation of accounts with different year ends. We recognise the issues identified by the
         <abbr title="National Audit Office">
          NAO
         </abbr>
         with this process. We take the concerns very seriously.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         We are working closely with the
         <abbr title="Her Majesty's">
          HM
         </abbr>
         Treasury to find a more sustainable solution to this process.
        </p>

       <p>
        The Comptroller and Auditor General has acknowledged improvements we are already making to the accounts process, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         improvements to the timeliness of returns received, having had only 22 academy trusts not provide information
        </li>
        <li>
         refining and improving the risk-based approach to data collected from academy trusts
        </li>
        <li>
         obtaining greater detail on academy trusts’ pension liabilities, which has removed a source of error identified in 2012 to 2013
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The department’s financial year ended on 31 March 2014, while academies produce their accounts for the academic year, which ended on 31 August 2013. Consolidating accounts from these 2 different time periods is a significant contributory factor to the level of error and uncertainty in the accounts.
