      Responding to the publication of the accounts, a department spokesperson said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       We are pleased the
       <abbr title="National Audit Office">
        NAO
       </abbr>
       has found no material inaccuracies in the financial statements of the department, the
       <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
        EFA
       </abbr>
       and the 3,905 academies included in this report.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, consolidating the accounts of thousands of academies is an enormous task. This is a complex procedure and the largest of its kind carried out in the UK, and involves the consolidation of accounts with different year ends. We recognise the issues identified by the
       <abbr title="National Audit Office">
        NAO
       </abbr>
       with this process. We take the concerns very seriously.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       We are working closely with the
       <abbr title="Her Majesty's">
        HM
       </abbr>
       Treasury to find a more sustainable solution to this process.
      </p>
     </blockquote>

     <p>
      The Comptroller and Auditor General has acknowledged improvements we are already making to the accounts process, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       improvements to the timeliness of returns received, having had only 22 academy trusts not provide information
      </li>
      <li>
       refining and improving the risk-based approach to data collected from academy trusts
      </li>
      <li>
       obtaining greater detail on academy trusts’ pension liabilities, which has removed a source of error identified in 2012 to 2013
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The department’s financial year ended on 31 March 2014, while academies produce their accounts for the academic year, which ended on 31 August 2013. Consolidating accounts from these 2 different time periods is a significant contributory factor to the level of error and uncertainty in the accounts.
