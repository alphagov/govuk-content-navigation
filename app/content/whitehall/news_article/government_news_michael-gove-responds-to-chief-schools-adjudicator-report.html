      Education Secretary Michael Gove said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       I would like to thank Dr Ian Craig, the Chief Schools Adjudicator, for his annual report, which raises a number of important issues.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       It is absolutely right that every parent should want their child to go to an excellent school, so school admissions will continue to be a controversial and sensitive issue as long as there are too few good school places.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       I am committed to driving up educational standards so all parents have that choice of high-quality schools close to home, which is why we are encouraging providers to set up new schools and turning round under-performing schools. And so no child is disadvantaged because of their background, I am introducing the pupil premium.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       I also intend to make the school admissions framework, including the School Admissions Code, simpler and fairer, and I have asked my officials to start speaking with key stakeholders.
      </p>
