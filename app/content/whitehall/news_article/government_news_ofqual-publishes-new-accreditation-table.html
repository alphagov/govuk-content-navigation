         The new table
        </a>
        shows clearly which qualifications being reformed for first teaching in September 2016 have been accredited and where others are in the system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each time a specification is accredited by the regulator, the table will be updated to reflect this.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where specifications have yet to be accredited, the table shows the stage it is at within the process. It also provides a date when an action is scheduled to have occurred, indicating when the reader should check back to see if new information is available. Specifications are processed as quickly as possible each time they are submitted.
       </p>

        Glenys Stacey, Chief Regulator, comments:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         We know itâ€™s vital that parents, students and particularly teachers are kept up to date on the progress being made with accreditation. We are making more information available today in a more accessible format and we will provide frequent updates.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         In September this year there will be new GCSEs, AS and A levels taught in 20 subjects, to complement the 3 GCSEs and 13 AS and A levels that began to be taught in September 2015. There are currently 50 specifications accredited, which is 32% of the total specifications expected to be submitted.
        </p>
       </blockquote>

        The new table will be updated at least once a week, and it will show when the last update took place. The table is part of a wider package of information materials that Ofqual has produced on the reform programme which includes an accreditation
