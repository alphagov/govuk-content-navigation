        The ICM Research survey shows that providing opportunities for young people to develop their interview skills and get some work experience under their belts, could help them secure employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over half (59%) of the employers polled said they had hired young people into entry level positions in the last five years, with 54% of these saying this was because the young recruit had prepared well for the interview.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, 2 in every 5 of all employers surveyed said they would be more likely to recruit a young person or school leaver who had done at  least 6 weeks’ high quality work experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        Traineeships were launched last year to help young people improve their employability prospects and unlock their potential. A traineeship provides the work preparation training, work experience and support with English and maths skills needed to get an apprenticeship or other job.  They are delivered by training organisations with the content tailored to the needs of the business and individual.
       </p>
       <p>
        The study also suggests the introduction of traineeships could even encourage employers to create more jobs for young people. Almost half (49%) of employers polled would consider creating a brand new role for a young person that impressed them during a work experience placement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Skills and enterprise minster, Matthew Hancock commented:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Creating more opportunities for young people to gain experience and confidence is crucial if we want to help them secure employment. Traineeships could be the difference which gives these young people their first break, unlocking their potential and giving them the work experience employers are looking for.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         However, it’s not just about work experience, the work preparation training offered through the traineeship such as CV writing and interview skills, together with English and maths, is of equal importance. It’s all part of our long term economic plan to help young people reach their potential.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The poll also provides employer insight into the other ways traineeships can help young people improve their chances of securing work. It finds:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         74% of employers surveyed would be more likely to recruit a young person or school leaver if they had prepared well for an interview
        </li>
        <li>
         48% of the employers polled would be more likely to recruit a young person or school leaver if they had a good reference from an employer or training organisation
        </li>
        <li>
         45% of the firms surveyed say an eye-catching and well-thought out CV would improve a young candidate’s chances of securing role
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Hundreds of employers, including the BBC, BT, Hollies Day Nursery, Port of Tilbury, Siemens and Virgin Media have already committed to helping young people through the Traineeship programme.
       </p>
       <p>
        Employers can find out how they can take on their first trainee and help develop talented young people with the practical skills they need for the workplace.
