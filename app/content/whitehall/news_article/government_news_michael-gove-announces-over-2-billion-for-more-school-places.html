       <p>
        Education Secretary Michael Gove has today (18 December 2013) announced £2.35 billion to create more school places up to 2017. This is in addition to the £5 billion that will have been spent on new school places by 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the first time councils have had 3-year allocations of funding to spend on school places. It means they can plan ahead and ensure every child has a school place.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a written ministerial statement issued today, Mr Gove announced that 260,000 new school places have been created to date, and that many more were on their way.
       </p>
       <p>
        He also announced:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Sebastian James’s review of progress since his original report on education capital
        </li>
        <li>
         the dedicated schools grant for 2014 to 2015
        </li>
        <li>
         further information on the £150 million of capital funding to support universal free school meals
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Education Secretary Michael Gove said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         This government’s overriding priority for capital investment is to ensure every child has a place at school. Demographic pressures have put strain on schools in many parts of the country. That is why we have more than doubled funding for new places to £5 billion in this parliament. By May 2013, this investment had already helped to create an additional 260,000 school places with more still to come. Today I am announcing an additional £2.35 billion to support local authorities to plan and create new school places that will be needed by 2017.
        </p>
