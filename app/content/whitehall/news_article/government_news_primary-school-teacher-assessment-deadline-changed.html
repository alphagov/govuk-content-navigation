        The deadline for primary schools to submit teacher assessments has been changed following a series of constructive conversations between the Department for Education and a headteaching union.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-assessments-letter-from-nick-gibb-to-the-naht">
         letter to the National Association of Head Teachers (
         <abbr title="National Association of Head Teachers">
          NAHT
         </abbr>
         )
        </a>
        , Schools Minister Nick Gibb confirmed that the department would listen to the concerns raised by the sector regarding the deadlines for this year’s assessments at key stage 1 and 2 and introduce a new revised deadline of 30 June for both.
       </p>
       <p>
        The change, for this year only, has been made in recognition of the unique circumstances for teachers working with a new framework to new standards, which will ensure more children are leaving primary school with the reading, writing and maths skills that will help them succeed at secondary school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clarification to guide teachers through the new 2016 assessment arrangements to eliminate any misunderstandings that could increase workloads will also be sent to schools. Regional schools commissioners will take into account the fact that schools are introducing new, more rigorous standards when considering school performance for this year. Nick Gibb has also written to Sir Michael Wilshaw to ask that his Ofsted inspectors consider the changes when reaching their judgements.
       </p>
       <p>
        School Minister Nick Gibb said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Throughout this important reform process we have worked closely with teachers and headteachers and continue to listen to the concerns of the profession as the details of the new arrangements are finalised. We are working constructively with the teaching profession and their representatives to find solutions to some of the remaining issues. The
         <abbr title="National Association of Head Teachers">
          NAHT
         </abbr>
         ’s readiness to work with us, rather than use the media to scaremonger, has meant that we have been able to have a sensible discussion.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         As a result we have made changes, which I hope will allay teachers’ concerns about workload and disruption, allowing us to continue working towards the goal we all want to achieve - the best possible education for all our children.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
