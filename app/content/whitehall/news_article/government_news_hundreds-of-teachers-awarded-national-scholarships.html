      The National Scholarship Fund for teachers, announced earlier in the year, was set up to help existing teachers in England to develop their skills and help them deepen their subject knowledge.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Coalition Government firmly believes that the quality of teachers and their professional development are enormously important. That is why, as set out in the Schools White Paper, the Government is committed to developing a strong culture of professional development where more teachers acquire postgraduate qualifications and are supported to progress further academically.
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost 2,000 teachers applied for the scheme, offering scholarships worth up to £3,500 each. The Department for Education today has confirmed the successful applications:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       280 scholarships for teachers working in priority subjects and specialisms - English, maths and science.
      </li>
      <li>
       391 scholarships for Special Education Needs (SEN) teachers.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       These scholarships have been awarded to teachers who have the potential to make a significant contribution to the country’s intellectual heritage through the acquisition of deeper subject knowledge.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Nothing is more important for raising standards in our schools than ensuring that we have more great teachers. These scholarships, alongside our other reforms to improve teacher recruitment and training, will elevate the status of the teaching profession.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The scheme is open to all qualified teachers. The maximum scholarship value is £3,500 but the value of each award varies depending on the type of activity funded. Around £2 million has been allocated for 2011/12 and we expect similar funding in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Applications in respect of the three priority subjects were received for a wide variety of activities ranging from a Masters in Applied Linguistics to attendance at a Summer School. SEN activity included MEd in Autism, MA in Special and Inclusive Education, and PG Diploma in Specific Learning Difficulties Dyslexia.
     </p>
     <p>
      The scholarships are awarded where applications are judged to be of sufficient merit. The first round of the scholarship scheme was awarded based on the following criteria:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       priority subjects/specialism - to include maths, English, science and Special Educational Needs;
      </li>
      <li>
       support from school - teachers will be required to demonstrate support from their school in terms of accessing resources and being able to carry out activities within and outside the school; and
      </li>
      <li>
       level and type of scholarship activity - encourages serving teachers to pursue knowledge independently to Masters level and beyond.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Brian Lamb, Chair of the Lamb Inquiry and Achievement for All, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       It is crucial that children with SEN, who have some of the most complex needs and challenges, are taught by teachers with the expertise and professional skills to match this challenge. This scholarship programme is vital if we are to have the well-trained and expert SEN teachers of the future. I was hugely impressed by the quality and commitment of the scholarship applicants. This programme can make a profound difference to the outcomes for children with SEN.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Ian McNeilly, Director of the National Association for the Teaching of English (NATE), said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       This prestigious national scholarship scheme will prove of great value to those teachers who have shown the initiative and commitment to undertake high-level professional development.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Professor Hilary Povey, Professor of Mathematics Education at Sheffield Hallam University, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       It was encouraging to see mathematics teachers’ thirst for further study of their subject and how best to teach it. I was delighted to be part of the process.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The National Scholarship Fund for teachers is administered by the Training and Development Agency for Teachers (TDA). The next round of applications for the scholarship funding is due to open in spring 2012. Further details can be found on the
