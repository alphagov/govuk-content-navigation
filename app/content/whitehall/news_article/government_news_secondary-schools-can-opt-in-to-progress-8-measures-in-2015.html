  Mainstream maintained schools, academies and free schools can now choose to adopt the new performance measures a year early in 2015.

      The new performance measures, to be introduced in 2016, are based on the progress 8 measure. They are designed to encourage schools to teach a broad curriculum and reward schools that teach all pupils well.
     </p>
     <p>
      The headline measures reported in performance tables from 2016 will be:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       pupils’ progress across 8 subjects (progress 8) from age 11 to 16, compared to others with the same results at age 11
      </li>
      <li>
       pupils’ average grade across 8 subjects
      </li>
      <li>
       the proportion of pupils achieving at least a C in English and mathematics
      </li>
      <li>
       the proportion of pupils achieving the English Baccalaureate
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Schools can benefit from this fairer way of being held to account by opting in a year early in 2015. By opting in, schools agree to be subject to new floor standard based on progress 8.
     </p>
     <p>
      The window for schools to opt in a year early to the new performance measures will open on 23 June 2014, and will close at the end of June 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      On 20 June 2014, we sent headteachers and principals information about the terms and conditions for opting in and the procedure for doing so. Schools must obtain the agreement of their governing bodies before signing up.
     </p>
     <p>
      In early 2015 schools will receive data indicating how the school would have performed against the new measures for its 2014 results. This information (which will not be published in the performance tables) will help each school plan for the new performance measures and decide whether to opt in early.
