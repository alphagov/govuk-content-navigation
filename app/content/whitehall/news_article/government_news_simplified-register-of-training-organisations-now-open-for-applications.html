      This is the annual refresh, so all organisations currently on
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sfa-register-of-training-organisations">
       the register
      </a>
      must successfully reapply to maintain their place on it.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the annual refresh, we have:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       widened the register’s scope to include more services – as well as covering education and training, it now incorporates advice and guidance, including delivery of the National Careers Service, and education and training development services.
      </li>
      <li>
       reduced the number of questions for organisations that do not wish to compete for SFA contracts in the future.
      </li>
      <li>
       ensured that the register complies with the new Public Contracts Regulations 2015, which came into effect in February.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      These changes form part of our plans to deliver a simple and consistent approach to supplier selection.
     </p>
     <p>
      Organisations must complete and pass our due diligence questions to appear on the register. Organisations that complete and pass both our due diligence and capacity and capability questions will be invited to compete for future funding opportunities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Organisations can access the questions on our
      <a href="https://skillsfundingagency.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.shtml" rel="external">
       e-tendering portal
      </a>
      , when we are open for applications. Our new

       guidance document
      </a>
      will support organisations with this.
