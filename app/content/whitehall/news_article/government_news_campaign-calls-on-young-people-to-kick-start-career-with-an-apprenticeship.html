       <p>
        Telling their stories, the apprentices, from top firms including IBM, JCB and Sellafield, will feature on billboards and television screens across England.
       </p>

        Campaign Star, Xavier Williams, of Lloyds Banking Group, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         It’s never too late to get an apprenticeship. If you are considering how to better your future then an apprenticeship would be a no-brainer. All it takes is self-confidence. I can’t recommend this route into employment highly enough.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The campaign will direct young people
        <a href="https://www.getingofar.gov.uk" rel="external">
         online
        </a>
        to www.getingofar.gov.uk where they’ll be able to find out more about the benefits and opportunities of apprenticeships. The website will also direct people to other options such work experience or a traineeship, if they’re not quite ready for an apprenticeship.

        New research figures also released today show that:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Around 90 per cent of employers and apprentices are satisfied with their programme
        </li>
        <li>
         Around 75 per cent of employers find that apprentices improve productivity or the quality of their products and services.
        </li>
        <li>
         Outcomes for apprentices remain strong with 92 per cent of apprentices employed around six months after completion
        </li>
        <li>
         The vast majority of apprentice employers committed to providing apprenticeships in the future.
