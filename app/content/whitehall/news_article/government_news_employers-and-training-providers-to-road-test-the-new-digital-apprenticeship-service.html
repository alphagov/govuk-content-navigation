       <p>
        Employers and training providers across England are getting the chance to test out the new digital apprenticeship service, to make sure it meets their needs and is ready for when the new apprenticeship funding system comes into effect.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of the design process, around 400 employers and 200 training providers have already tested the system. Even more are now being invited to register to take part in a pilot of testing during October and November 2016. A representative sample of employers and training providers will be selected from those who register and will test the service from start to finish, just as they will when using the service for real.
       </p>
       <p>
        We want to be sure the new service is easy for employers and training providers to use, and the best way to make sure of that is to ask them. By taking part in the pilot employers and training providers will help to shape the design of the digital apprenticeship service.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will issue more information on how employers and training providers can use the digital apprenticeship service later this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether they pay the levy or not, the digital apprenticeship service will help employers to select an apprenticeship framework or standard, choose the training provider or providers you want to deliver the training, choose an assessment organisation and advertise and recruit to apprenticeship vacancies.
