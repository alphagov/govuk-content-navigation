        Goldman Sachs is today (Tuesday, 26 January) announcing the launch of an apprenticeship programme in London, in partnership with Queen Mary University of London (QMUL).
       </p>
       <p>
        The ‘Degree Apprenticeship Programme’ will allow participants to complete an apprenticeship within Goldman Sachs’ technology division, whilst studying for a degree at QMUL. After the four-year programme, participants will graduate with a bachelor’s degree in Digital and Technology Solutions, with the potential opportunity of a full-time position with Goldman Sachs. The format of the programme offers the students a path to higher education, whilst also receiving a competitive salary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Harriett Baldwin MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         A key part of the government’s long term plan is to ensure that our workforce has the skills it needs to succeed. That is why we’re committed to creating 3 million apprenticeships by 2020.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         I know from personal experience the career opportunities that are available in financial services and that is why I am delighted that Goldman Sachs is launching a new degree-level apprenticeship programme today. This is an exciting scheme that will give young people the opportunity to forge careers in one of Britain’s most important industries.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Sue Husband, Director of the National Apprenticeship Service said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         It is great to have a multi-national global investment banking organisation on board, offering a quality apprenticeship programme. The Goldman Sachs programme will enable students to take up a path to higher education, through one of the UK’s leading universities, Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), whilst also receiving a competitive salary.
        </p>

         </a>
         today, on their current apprenticeship programme, is a great example of how learners and employers are making the most of the benefits of apprenticeships. I look forward to hearing from the new recruits as they progress through their Degree Apprenticeship programme and, from Goldman Sachs and QMUL on the business benefits of this collaborative partnership.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        To promote apprenticeships in the financial services, Goldman Sachs is hosting a roundtable event today and CISI (the Chartered Institute for Securities and Investment) is hosting a conference. The Prime Minister’s Apprenticeship Advisor, Nadhim Zawahi MP, will be attending both events.
       </p>
       <p>
        Businesses from across the financial sector, such as the big 5 high street banks, insurance firms, such as Prudential, Royal Sun Alliance and Aviva, and more recently investment banks, such as UBS and industry partners, are making a valuable contribution to leading the way by employing apprentices. They are also actively involved with informing the development of new
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/apprenticeship-standards">
         apprenticeship standards
        </a>
        , which range from entry level roles to the development of Degree Apprenticeships that will support elite careers and training to the highest levels for individuals thinking about professional roles in the industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The events today will enable further financial sector organisations to hear from sector leaders and consider the benefits that starting or expanding your apprenticeships programme could bring to their business.
