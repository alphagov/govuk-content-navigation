        The current contracts, with CfBT, Serco and Tribal, have run since September 2009 and are due to expire in August 2015, requiring Ofsted to review its inspection delivery model.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additional Inspectors (AIs), who are currently contracted through ISPs to undertake inspections on behalf of Ofsted, will continue to form a significant part of the inspection work force. However, from September 2015, AIs will be contracted directly by Ofsted, giving Ofsted more direct control over their selection, training and quality assurance.At his speech to the Association of School and College Leaders in March this year, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, made clear his commitment to change the working model saying: ’Inspection, as far as I’m concerned, is just too important for Ofsted to simply have oversight of third-party arrangements.’
       </p>
       <p>
        Commenting on the decision, Ofsted’s Director of Corporate Services, Nick Jackson said: ‘For the last five years our Inspection Service Providers have delivered a successful and professional inspection programme for Ofsted. With the conclusion of these contracts the time was right to look again at how Ofsted can best deliver a service that is both efficient and flexible. We are confident that this is the right model.’
       </p>
       <p>
        Ofsted intends that its existing contractual arrangements for the delivery of early years inspections will continue.
