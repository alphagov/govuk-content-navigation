        Jill Pullen has been re-appointed to serve as a member of the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) and will serve for a further three years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The STRB provides independent advice to the government on pay and conditions for just under half a million teachers and school leaders in England and Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Miss Pullen retired in 2007 after 25 years as a head teacher of a large primary school. She has maintained a close involvement with education since her retirement through work as chair of an interim executive board and was a member of the governing council of the National College. She has been a non-executive director in the NHS for a number of years and is a lay member of employment tribunals. She is presently a schools adjudicator.

         The School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) considers aspects of teachers’ pay and conditions for just under half a million teachers and school leaders in England and Wales. Its work has a direct impact on teachers and head teachers and through them on the education of children.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The STRB was established under the terms of the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Act 1991 (as replaced by the Education Act 2002). It is a statutory independent advisory body. Its function is to consider matters referred to it by the Secretary of State for Education in relation to the remuneration, professional duties or working time of school teachers and to report to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State.
