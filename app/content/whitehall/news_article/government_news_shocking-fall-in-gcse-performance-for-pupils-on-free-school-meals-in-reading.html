        The inspectorate has published a
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-results-in-reading-schools">
         letter calling on Reading Borough Council to do more to help improve exam results
        </a>
        – particularly for children on free school meals (
        <abbr title="free school meals">
         FSM
        </abbr>
        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bradley Simmons, Ofsted Regional Director for the South East, said that GCSE results in Reading show a wide and worsening gap between the achievement of
        <abbr title="free school meals">
         FSM
        </abbr>
        pupils and their better-off peers in the same borough and across England.
       </p>
       <p>
        The overall percentage of pupils achieving 5 or more GCSEs at grade A* to C including English and mathematics fell from 59.3% in 2014, to 57.5% in 2015. Today’s letter says this decline is overshadowed by a shocking fall in the GCSE performance of those pupils eligible for free school meals. In 2014, 30.7% of
        <abbr title="free school meals">
         FSM
        </abbr>
        pupils achieved 5 GCSEs at grades A* to C including English and mathematics. In 2015, only 23.8% achieved this level.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bradley Simmons said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Pupils on free school meals in Reading get the worst GCSE results of any area in the south east. Reading’s results show a wide and worsening gap between the achievement of these pupils and their more advantaged peers, both locally and nationally.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         I am concerned about overall GCSE results in the borough. These pupils deserve better if they are to have a brighter future. Local authorities have a responsibility to champion their most vulnerable pupils. That is why I am calling on Reading Borough Council to explain what they are doing to address this serious situation.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2014 Ofsted expressed concerns about the poor performance of primary schools in Reading. Steps have since been taken to improve the situation; however, Ofsted remains concerned that the problem has been transferred to the borough’s secondary schools.
