      Education Minister Elizabeth Truss underlined the government’s commitment to supporting the arts by confirming funding for a scheme that allows young dancers and musicians from disadvantaged backgrounds to attend world-class institutions like the Royal Ballet School (
      <abbr title="Royal Ballet School">
       RBS
      </abbr>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      The minister said that the music and dance scheme, which gives financial assistance to talented young artists who could not otherwise afford to attend, will receive £28 million for the next financial year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The money will help young people attend 8 specialist independent schools and 21 centres for advanced training, including the
      <abbr title="Royal Ballet School">
       RBS
      </abbr>
      . Currently 89% of students attending the
      <abbr title="Royal Ballet School">
       RBS
      </abbr>
      receive financial assistance through this fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      During her visit to the
      <abbr title="Royal Ballet School">
       RBS
      </abbr>
      , the minister also announced the Arts Council England’s new easy-to-use online resource
      <a href="http://www.nfer.ac.uk/CulturalEducationResources/" rel="external">
       cultural resources
      </a>
      . From the Ashmolean Museum to the National Theatre this new resource gives teachers access to a store of information profiling the best of British culture, encouraging pupils to engage in the arts.
     </p>
     <p>
      And following the submission of further evidence to the department, Ms Truss also confirmed results in dance and drama
      <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
       GCSEs
      </abbr>
      will count separately in school performance tables.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Truss said jobs of the future would require both creativity and the academic fundamentals of good literacy, numeracy and science.
     </p>
     <p>
      Elizabeth Truss said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       In an increasingly competitive labour market, young people need both core knowledge and the opportunity to be creative and artistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s why we are supporting young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who want to take part in music and arts education.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       This will ensure music and arts become an integral part of school life, giving our children a well-rounded education.
      </p>

       The government has committed £64 million to music and cultural education programmes over the next 12 months. This includes £58 million for 123 music education hubs, £1.2 million for a museums and schools programme and £1 million to the British Film Institute’s Film Academy for aspiring young filmmakers. The government’s commitment to cultural education is set out in the

       The government’s new accountability measure for secondary schools - Progress 8 - which is introduced for the 2016 performance tables will measure pupil progress across 8 subjects and can include 3 arts subjects, providing a further incentive for schools to enter children for arts subjects.
      </li>

       Dance and drama will count separately in the next school performance tables, based on 2014 results and published in January 2015.
