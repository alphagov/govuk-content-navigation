      Schools Minister Nick Gibb today presented Cambridgeshire County Council with an award after coming top of Stonewall’s 2011 Education Equality Index. The winner was revealed by celebrity stylist Gok Wan at Stonewall’s Education for All Conference in London.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nick Gibb MP said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I would like to congratulate Cambridgeshire County Council - the winner’s of Stonewall’s Education Equality Index 2011. They have shown how bullying, and in particular homophobic bullying, can be tackled effectively. Successful schools have clear policies - developed with pupils and parents - that result in pupils understanding what is expected of them.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Tackling poor behaviour and bullying are top priorities for the Coalition Government. We are supporting schools to take a zero tolerance approach to all forms of bullying. We need to send the message that homophobic bullying, of any kind and of any child, is completely unacceptable. No child should have to suffer fear, victimisation or disruption as a result of bullying, either on or off school premises. Homophobic language should become as unacceptable as racial slurs.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
