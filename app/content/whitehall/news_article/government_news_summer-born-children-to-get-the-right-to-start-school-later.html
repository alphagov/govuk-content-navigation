      Schools Minister Nick Gibb announced the government’s intention to give summer-born children the right to start in reception at the age of 5.
     </p>
     <p>
      The minister said admissions rules must be changed so children born between April 1 and August 31 cannot be forced to go straight into year 1 if they wait to start school until they turn 5.
     </p>
     <p>
      He has written an open letter to encourage schools and local authorities to take immediate action, in advance of the proposed changes, and allow summer-born children to start in reception aged 5 if that is what parents want.
     </p>
     <p>
      The government believes parents and teachers are best placed to decide what is right for their child, and summer-born children should have the same opportunity to excel at school as their peers - even if that means starting reception a year later.
     </p>
     <p>
      The changes are designed to give parents and teachers flexibility, and the majority of summer-born children will still start school when they turn 4 rather than waiting.
     </p>
     <p>
      If they do start school later, the children will be able to remain with the same age group as they progress, including into secondary school.
     </p>
     <p>
      Children usually start school in the September after they turn 4 but parents of summer-born children can ask to delay entry to reception for a year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools and councils often say summer-born pupils must go straight into year 1 and miss out on the reception year altogether - as a result parents can feel pressured to send their child to school before they are ready.
     </p>
     <p>
      A consultation will now be carried out now and the reforms will have to be approved by Parliament.
     </p>
     <p>
      In his letter, the minister said that the existing system is not working - with parents and the authorities ‘often failing to agree on what is in the child’s best interests’.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       As part of our plan to extend social justice and opportunity, we want all children to have an equal chance to excel in school regardless of when they are born.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parents know their children best and we want to make sure summer-born children can start reception at the age of 5, if their parents think it is in their best interests.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       We are going to make changes to admission rules - but we want councils and academies to take immediate action.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">
       school admissions code
      </a>
      currently requires the admission authority to make a decision on the year group a summer-born 5-year-old should be admitted to on the basis of the circumstances of the case and in the best interests of the child.
     </p>
     <p>
      Parents also have the right to send their child to school on a part-time basis before they reach the compulsory school age.
     </p>
     <p>
      In his letter, the minister wrote:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       We have decided that it is necessary to amend the school admissions code further to ensure that summer-born children can be admitted to the reception class at the age of 5 if it is in line with their parents’ wishes, and to ensure that those children are able to remain with that cohort as they progress through school, including through to secondary school.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       We will conduct a full public consultation in due course; and subject to Parliamentary approval will introduce these further changes to ensure that no child is forced to start school before they are ready.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
