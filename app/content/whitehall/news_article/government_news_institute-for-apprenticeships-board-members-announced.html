      Full details of how the Institute for Apprenticeships will operate have today (27 January 2017) been set out in an
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/institute-for-apprenticeships-draft-operational-plan">
       operational plan for consultation
      </a>
      alongside the names of 8 members of the board appointed to run the institute.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the institute’s main jobs when it starts operating in April 2017 will be to support the government’s drive to deliver 3 million quality apprenticeships by 2020, and that businesses get the skilled workforce they need to prosper, so it is vital that employers are well represented.
     </p>
     <p>
      That is why the board will be made up primarily of employers, business leaders and their representatives.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apprenticeships and Skills Minister Robert Halfon said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       It is fantastic to see such a diverse board who will bring their varied and high-level experience to the Institute for Apprenticeships to ensure apprenticeships are of the highest quality they can be.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       With employer expertise at its heart, the Institute for Apprenticeships will play a crucial role in raising the prestige of apprenticeships and ensuring employers can get the skilled workforce they desperately need.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The operational plan, published for consultation, will set out how the institute will take the lead on a number of ongoing reforms to improve the apprenticeship system. It details how the institute will provide advice to the government on funding and ensure employers get the quality skills that they need from the apprenticeship system.
     </p>
     <p>
      Following consultation, the plan will set out how the Institute for Apprenticeships will deliver its functions to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       improve the quality of apprenticeships
      </li>
      <li>
       regulate the quality of apprenticeship standards and assessment plans
      </li>
      <li>
       provide advice to government on the pricing of apprenticeship standards
      </li>
      <li>
       establish how the institute will collaborate with partners to drive quality across the apprenticeships system
      </li>
      <li>
       gain more information and insight on how we will lead the reforms to technical education
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Shadow Chair for the Institute for Apprenticeships Antony Jenkins said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I believe this is an excellent, high-calibre board that will help the institute drive up the quality of apprenticeships.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Today’s publication of the draft operational plan is the culmination of lots of hard work and engagement over the last 6 months and I am very grateful to all the stakeholders who have helped us prepare it.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The introduction of an apprenticeship levy from April 2017 represents the biggest set of changes to apprenticeship funding since the re-introduction of modern apprenticeships in the mid-1990s.
