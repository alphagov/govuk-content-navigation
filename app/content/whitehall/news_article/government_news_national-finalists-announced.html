      Nine apprentices and 18 apprentice employers have been named as finalists, representing a wide variety of sectors and roles.  An apprentice champion winner will also be announced on the night.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now in their 13th year, the National Apprenticeship Awards will take place on 20 January 2017 at Grosvenor House, Park Lane, London.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses and apprentices will have to beat tough competition from across the country to win or be recognised as highly commended in their category.
     </p>
     <p>
      Winners on the night will have demonstrated how employers can grow their own talent with apprenticeships and how apprentices make a significant contribution to the workplace.

      Sue Husband, director, National Apprenticeship Service said:
     </p>
     <p>
      “The awards process is in its final stages. We now know who the successful finalists are and I am really looking forward to hearing more about each finalist and their apprenticeship experience at our awards ceremony in January.
     </p>
     <p>
      We should congratulate everyone who has reached this stage and been recognised as a finalist at a national level. Whatever happens on the night, each apprentice and employer deserves recognition for committing to and delivering on apprenticeships and for these individuals and employers, the level of success and impact brought by apprenticeships is huge.
     </p>
     <p>
      Good luck to all finalists and thanks once again to our committed sponsors for supporting the 2016 awards.”
