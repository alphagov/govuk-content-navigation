       </p>
       <p>

       <p>
        Winners on the night will have demonstrated how employers can grow their own talent with apprenticeships and how apprentices make a significant contribution to the workplace.

        Sue Husband, director, National Apprenticeship Service said:
       </p>
       <p>
        “The awards process is in its final stages. We now know who the successful finalists are and I am really looking forward to hearing more about each finalist and their apprenticeship experience at our awards ceremony in January.
       </p>
       <p>
        We should congratulate everyone who has reached this stage and been recognised as a finalist at a national level. Whatever happens on the night, each apprentice and employer deserves recognition for committing to and delivering on apprenticeships and for these individuals and employers, the level of success and impact brought by apprenticeships is huge.
       </p>
       <p>
        Good luck to all finalists and thanks once again to our committed sponsors for supporting the 2016 awards.”
