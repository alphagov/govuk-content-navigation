      Following on from last year’s online training on funding, the Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      ) has launched a series of
      <a href="https://registration.livegroup.co.uk/academyfinance/" rel="external">
       online presentations and interactive webinars
      </a>
      to support academy trusts in completing their financial returns and understanding the financial accountability and assurance framework.
     </p>
     <p>
      This online approach allows academy trusts instant access to relevant information and training. You can view the material from your computer at a convenient time, without the need for travel.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can
      <a href="https://registration.livegroup.co.uk/academyfinance/" rel="external">
       register now and submit questions
      </a>
      for the webinars on the March accounts return (15 May, 2pm) and the 2014 to 2015 budget forecast (9 June, 2pm). A panel of
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      staff will answer your questions during the live webinars. You can now also watch our
      <a href="https://registration.livegroup.co.uk/academyfinance/" rel="external">

     </p>
     <p>
      The budget forecast webinar is aimed at all academy trusts. The March accounts return only has to be completed by academy trusts that did not prepare financial statements at 31 August 2013 or opened new academies between 1 September 2013 and 31 March 2014
     </p>
     <p>
      On 15 July,

      </abbr>
      will hold webinars aimed at all academy trusts (11am) and their auditors (2pm) on the academies financial framework, including the accounts direction and financial handbook. Registration for these webinars is
