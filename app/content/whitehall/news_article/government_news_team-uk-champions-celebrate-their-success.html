        Speaking at the welcome back event, Peter Lauener said: “Attending WorldSkills São Paulo 2015 was a life changing event. I was enthralled to see first-hand the energy, the endeavour and the ‘never give up’ spirit shown by Team UK. It was inspiring to watch and a remarkable achievement for all those that took part. My congratulations go to all the Medal winners, the Medallion winners and the entire Team UK.”
