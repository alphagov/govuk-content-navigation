      This week marked the welcome back for Team UK from WorldSkills São Paulo 2015. WorldSkills is the world’s largest skills competition, which is held around the globe to celebrate skills and share best practice between industries and countries. Team UK did exceptionally well and came away with three gold, four silver and two bronze medals, together with 24 Medallions for Excellence.

      Speaking at the welcome back event, Peter Lauener said: “Attending WorldSkills São Paulo 2015 was a life changing event. I was enthralled to see first-hand the energy, the endeavour and the ‘never give up’ spirit shown by Team UK. It was inspiring to watch and a remarkable achievement for all those that took part. My congratulations go to all the Medal winners, the Medallion winners and the entire Team UK.”
