       <p>
        Sir,
       </p>
       <p>
        It is true that we are only selecting the very best applications from groups who want to run new, taxpayer-funded free schools (‘Most applicants to run free schools are turned down’, 11 May 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that we have had such a strong response to free schools and academies shows a clear demand for more good local schools, where heads have control - not bureaucrats or ministers. Figures released this week show that more than 1,000 schools have applied to become academies, and nearly a fifth of all secondary schools now enjoy academy freedoms.
       </p>
       <p>
        Children from the poorest backgrounds have been let down the most by inequalities in our schools system. So I am delighted that excellent new free schools will be set up in disadvantaged areas like inner-city Bradford and Edmonton, London.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our reforms are about creating a generation of brilliant schools, free from meddling and prescription, that provide more children with the type of education previously reserved for the rich.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lord Hill of Oareford
       </p>
       <p>
        Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Schools
