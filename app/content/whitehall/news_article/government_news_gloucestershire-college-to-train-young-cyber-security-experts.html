      Thousands of students in Gloucestershire will be trained to become experts in engineering and cyber security at a new college backed by leading local firms announced today.
     </p>
     <p>
      SGS Berkeley Green University Technical College (
      <abbr title="university technical college">
       UTC
      </abbr>
      ) will train up to 660 14- to 19-year-olds in digital technologies, cyber security and advanced manufacturing, with students gaining valuable technical qualifications while studying core academic
      <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
       GCSEs
      </abbr>
      and A levels, such as English and maths.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <abbr title="university technical college">
       UTC
      </abbr>
      will work with a number of local firms including engineering company Versarien, fire and security systems experts Allcooper, and Messier-Bugatti-Dowty, a world-leading supplier of aircraft landing gear and braking systems. The
      <abbr title="university technical college">
       UTC
      </abbr>
      will also be sponsored by the University of Gloucestershire, giving students the best possible preparation for working life or further study.
     </p>
     <p>
      The projected growth in the south-west’s digital engineering and manufacturing sectors has led employers to call for more students to be trained in digital engineering and manufacturing, leading to the backing of a new school to address this shortfall in skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister Lord Nash announced the college alongside a visit to meet engineering employers. He said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Equipping young people with the skills they need to secure great jobs is a key part of our plan for education – resulting in the lowest level on record of young people not in education, employment or training.

       SGS Berkeley Green

       will provide Gloucestershire with generations of skilled digital technology, cyber security and advanced manufacturing experts. It is a perfect example of how we are placing technical education on a par with academic learning, while helping our thriving economy to flourish.

       The development of a

       will go a long way in ensuring these skills meet the demand of the region and I am delighted we will be part of this venture moving forward, helping to shape the future of any possible Brunels.
