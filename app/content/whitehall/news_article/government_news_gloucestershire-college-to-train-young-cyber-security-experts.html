        Thousands of students in Gloucestershire will be trained to become experts in engineering and cyber security at a new college backed by leading local firms announced today.
       </p>
       <p>
        SGS Berkeley Green University Technical College (
        <abbr title="university technical college">
         UTC
        </abbr>
        ) will train up to 660 14- to 19-year-olds in digital technologies, cyber security and advanced manufacturing, with students gaining valuable technical qualifications while studying core academic
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
         GCSEs
        </abbr>
        and A levels, such as English and maths.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <abbr title="university technical college">
         UTC
        </abbr>
        will work with a number of local firms including engineering company Versarien, fire and security systems experts Allcooper, and Messier-Bugatti-Dowty, a world-leading supplier of aircraft landing gear and braking systems. The
        <abbr title="university technical college">
         UTC
        </abbr>
        will also be sponsored by the University of Gloucestershire, giving students the best possible preparation for working life or further study.
       </p>
       <p>
        The projected growth in the south-west’s digital engineering and manufacturing sectors has led employers to call for more students to be trained in digital engineering and manufacturing, leading to the backing of a new school to address this shortfall in skills.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister Lord Nash announced the college alongside a visit to meet engineering employers. He said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Equipping young people with the skills they need to secure great jobs is a key part of our plan for education – resulting in the lowest level on record of young people not in education, employment or training.
        </p>
