      Taking place at the Birmingham NEC between 17 to 19 November, over 72,000 people turned out to visit employers, training providers, the National Careers Service and the National Apprenticeship Service and to witness the wide array of skills competitions taking place. The event also saw visits from Skills Minister Robert Halfon, who met with potential future apprentices, and Shadow Skills Minister Gordon Marsden.
     </p>
     <p>
      From the Get In Go Far stand to the National Careers Service hubs and staff from the National Apprenticeship Service and Amazing Apprenticeships (partner in the delivery of support and knowledge in schools) in The Staff Room, those who attended got the chance to see and hear about what career options are out there.
     </p>
     <p>
      Skills and Apprenticeships Minister Robert Halfon said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The Skills Show is a fantastic event which gives people the chance to learn first-hand about all the opportunities that are out there. It was brilliant going along and meeting so many talented young people attending the show.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Good careers advice is vital in helping young people make informed decisions and climb the ladder of opportunity to fulfilling jobs.

      The National Apprenticeship Service stand saw 3,206 visitors this year, demonstrating just how many people were eager to learn about all the choices out there. 553 teachers, careers advisors, FE Colleges, Awarding Bodies, parents and young people were also spoken with over the course of the 3 days in the Staff Room area. In addition, almost 200 schools signed up to receive free inspirational sessions for their students in their school.
     </p>
     <p>
      Careers advisers from the National Careers Service were offering careers advice at the Skills Show and spoke to over 6,800 young people, teachers and parents during the three days. The National Careers Service also delivered three spotlight sessions giving an insight into what the National Careers Service can offer individuals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Feedback we have had from the event were extremely positive about the service and enthusiasm from the National Apprenticeship Service ‘Get In Go Far’ branded stand. Colleagues from the National Apprenticeship Service were also supported on the stand by 6 young apprentice ambassadors from the North West network.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sue Husband, director of the National Apprenticeship Service said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       The Skills Show is a fantastic occasion for young people, teachers, parents and carers all considering career options for themselves or for the young people they are connected to. Apprenticeships are a real job, with training, a salary and a sound start to a future career. I hope those individuals who took time to speak to our team on the National Apprenticeship Service stand took away with them the real potential and opportunity that apprenticeships bring.
