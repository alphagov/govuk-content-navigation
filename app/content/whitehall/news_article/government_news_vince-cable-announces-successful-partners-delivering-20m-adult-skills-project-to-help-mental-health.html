      Business Secretary Vince Cable said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Mental health is a serious issue that affects many individuals and families. I have personal experience of seeing the role community learning can play in helping people who experience mental health problems.  Doing a course -  whether it be learning to manage stress or learning a new craft - can not only improve wellbeing but can support recovery and help people get on track to work and reconnect with their families and communities.
      </p>

     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       These Community Learning Mental Health pilots will support thousands of people in their recovery. I am pleased to be able to announce the Community Learning providers who will be working across the country to roll out the pilot programme and wish them every success.
      </p>
     </blockquote>

      Peter Lauener Skills Funding Agency Chief Executive said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       The government’s funding commitment brings together various bodies across government and the sector, to ensure support is available to those with mental health problems.  Funds committed by government will enable the development and delivery of courses to support adults aged 19+ and appropriate training for teachers, managers and volunteers. I look forward to seeing the evaluation of how projects have engaged, supported and provided help to those experiencing mental health problems in local communities.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Building on models of existing effective practice, providers awarded the funding across

      , must develop their proposal in conjunction with their local mental health partners.
     </p>
     <p>
      The contract will cover the period April 2015 to March 2016. Learners must complete their learning by 31 March 2016.
