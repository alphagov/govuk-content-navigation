       Jaguar Land Rover, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic get on board

     <p>
      Fifteen brand new University Technical Colleges (UTCs) have today been approved to open in 2013 and 2014. They will have involvement from around 200 high-profile employers - including household names like Jaguar Land Rover, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. They will also have significant input from world-class universities, such as Cambridge and Warwick.
     </p>
     <p>
      They range from a UTC specialising in aviation engineering, located close to London Heathrow Airport, to one in Warwick that will focus on delivering a business-like education - with input from over 30 employers - in engineering with digital technology. One project will also be based at the new MediaCityUK in Salford - home to much of the BBC and other media outlets.
     </p>
     <p>
      UTCs will create opportunities for more than 20,000 young people to train as the engineers and scientists of the future - playing a crucial role in the UK’s long-term economic growth. They will offer hands-on technical learning alongside academic GCSEs and A levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      The projects approved today join 17 UTCs that are already working to open this September or next. The number of UTCs in the pipeline now exceeds the Government’s ambition to create 24 by 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister Lord Hill said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       I am very pleased to be announcing another wave of strong UTC proposals. Right around the country there is a lot of enthusiasm from employers, universities, pupils and parents for high quality rigorous technical education. They provide more choice for children as well as helping provide the kind of highly skilled technicians our economy needs. The response from employers to UTCs speaks for itself.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      UTCs are Academies for 14-19-year-olds. Pupils choose to go to them at ages 14 or 16. They focus on providing technical education that meets the needs of modern business. Each has one or two specialisms - ranging from engineering, to manufacturing, to construction or bio-medical sciences. Students spend around 60 per cent of their time on core academic subjects, and the rest of their time learning specific technical skills and qualifications.
     </p>
     <p>
      All UTCs are sponsored by a local university and employers. The involvement of universities and employers means that students benefit from work placements, guest speakers, and a curriculum designed by experts in the field. Many also run longer term times and operate business hours to help prepare students for the world of work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The combination of a strong technical and academic education ensures that students are ready for work or further study at college or university.
     </p>
     <p>
      The projects approved today include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Warwick UTC has involvement from the University of Warwick and Jaguar Land Rover, amongst other local stakeholders. It will offer a business-like education to 640 pupils - working to business hours - and will specialise in engineering with digital technology.
      </li>
      <li>
       Heathrow Aviation Engineering UTC will specialise in aviation engineering. Its sponsors include Brunel University, BAA, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and RAF Northolt. It will offer 600 students the opportunity to acquire the skills for an industry which contributes around £17billion to the UK economy in economic output.
      </li>
      <li>
       UTC Cambridge is sponsored by Cambridge Regional College, Cambridge University Health Partners and a range of employers which are leaders in biomedical and environmental science and technologies. The UTC will specialise in these areas. It will cater for 670 students.
      </li>
      <li>
       The MediaCityUK UTC will be based in the heart of the country’s first media city on Salford Quays. It will cater for 720 pupils, who will specialise in skills linked to the creative and digital industries. It will help ensure that employers at MediaCityUK and their supply chains have access to the enterprising, skilled talent pool they need to flourish. It is also important for the local area, as some neighbourhoods immediately surrounding MediaCityUK are within the top one per cent most deprived in England.
      </li>
      <li>
       Elstree UTC will be based in Hertfordshire and will offer a technical education to 600 students. It will offer two specialisms: entertainment technologies and crafts, and electronic engineering and digital technologies. Elstree students will also have a longer school day than students at a traditional secondary school. Its proposed location in Elstree means it will benefit from the knowledge and expertise of high-profile entertainment and creative industries in Hertfordshire and London.

     <p>
      Two are already open - the JCB Academy in Staffordshire, and the Black Country UTC in Walsall (both West Midlands).

      17 others are already in the pre-opening phase.
     </p>

      This brings the total to 32 since May 2010 (the Government’s ambition was to approve 24 by 2014/15).

      Three UTCs will open in September:
     </p>
     <p>
      Aston University UTC. This is a new building. The Principal is in place and the curriculum is being developed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hackney UTC. This will open on a site presently owned by Hackney Community College. Building, refurbishment and equipment costs have been agreed and a Principal has been appointed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Central Bedfordshire UTC is supported by Cranfield University and the University of Bedfordshire. The Principal has been appointed.
