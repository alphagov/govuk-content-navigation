      The New Year 2017 Honours list published on Friday 30 December 2016 recognises over 120 people for their contribution to education or children’s services, and those who have made a difference to equality and diversity.
     </p>
     <p>
      The list of award recipients covers all phases of education in schools, colleges and universities. It also covers people who have contributed in an outstanding way to children’s services, such as foster carers, children’s social workers, and those working in adoption and in early years settings.
     </p>
