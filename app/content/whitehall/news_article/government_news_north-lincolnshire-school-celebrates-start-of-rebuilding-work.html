        Pupils at a north Lincolnshire school are holding a ceremony today (12 October 2015) to mark the start of work to create a brand new building and sports village through the government’s flagship rebuilding programme.
       </p>
       <p>
        Baysgarth School, a secondary school in Barton-upon-Humber, is 1 of 8 schools across north and north-east Lincolnshire to be rebuilt through the £4.4 billion
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/priority-school-building-programme-psbp" rel="external">
         priority school building programme (
         <abbr title="priority school building programme">
          PSBP
         </abbr>
         )
        </a>
        , which is transforming some of the most run-down schools in the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thanks to £13.8 million worth of construction, the school’s old buildings will be replaced with a new 2-storey facility, with an accompanying sports village. This village, featuring a new skate park and modern changing facilities, has benefited from a local authority contribution of around £670,000 towards the rebuild.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister Lord Nash said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Our investment in school buildings across the country is transforming the learning environment for tens of thousands of pupils and their teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The start of construction at Baysgarth School is a key milestone for the priority school building programme in north and north-east Lincolnshire.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Ensuring all children have access to the best possible schools and facilities is just one part of our commitment to help all young people reach their potential regardless of their background. These buildings will provide modern, fit-for-purpose schools for pupils for many years to come.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Baysgarth School Headteacher Richard Briggs said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         There is a real sense of excitement in the school and the wider community about the new build. These fantastic new facilities will serve the Barton area for the next 40 years and I am very proud to be the headteacher who oversees the handover.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Together with the sports village which will develop on-site as part of the new build project, this scheme will put Baysgarth at the forefront of educational provision in north Lincolnshire. Without a doubt it will support us in our aim to be an ‘outstanding’ school within the next 3 years.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Jon Marston of Galliford Try said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         We are delighted to have started construction works on site after many months working with the school and the Education Funding Agency (
         <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
          EFA
         </abbr>
         ) designing and planning the project. This planning has allowed us to carry out significant enabling works over the summer holidays and the new school will now begin construction for completion in January 2017.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         The staff and pupils at Baysgarth Secondary School will have exciting new buildings tailored to their needs and built to meet the standards required of a modern school.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Work on the main building of the school is due for completion by January 2017.

        Thanks to the
        <abbr title="priority school building programme">
         PSBP
        </abbr>
        , school buildings are being rebuilt faster and cheaper than those built under the previous school building initiative - Building Schools for the Future (
        <abbr title="building schools for the future">
         BSF
        </abbr>
        ). Under the

        it took 3 years for construction work to begin. This was slashed to 1 year for the
        <abbr title="priority school building programme">
         PSBP
        </abbr>
        , with projects costing around a third less.
       </p>
       <p>
        A total of 537 schools will benefit from construction through the 2 phases of the
        <abbr title="priority school building programme">

          The priority school building programme was established in 2011. A total of

           260 schools

          Thanks to decisions which have been taken to improve efficiency and reduce waste, significant work on those projects is already underway. In September, 22 buildings re-opened through
