        The Department for Education today published statistics showing pupil achievements in the 2010 key stage 2 national curriculum tests and teacher assessments for 11-year-old pupils in England.
        <br>
         Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:
        </br>
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         These figures show that many primary schools are providing a first-class education for their pupils - indeed, in more than 100 schools every child achieved the expected level in both English and maths, and progressed at the rate we’d expect in those subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
         But we want every child, at every school, to fulfil their potential.
        </p>
        <p>
         Currently half of all 10- and 11-year-old boys who qualify for free school meals are being let down by our education system. It is unacceptable that after seven years of primary school these children are not at the standard in English and maths that they need to flourish at secondary school.
        </p>
        <p>
         It’s why we are putting such an emphasis on improving pupils’ reading ability in the first years of primary school, with a focus on phonics.
        </p>
        <p>
         It’s why we are making the raising of standards of behaviour in schools a priority and why we are supporting teachers and headteachers to instil a zero-tolerance approach to poor behaviour in class.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         And it’s why we are introducing new fair but firm floor standards to identify underperforming schools - but schools with challenging intakes won’t be classified as underperforming if their pupils progress well. We will recognise the unique circumstances of every school.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         And we are also bringing in the pupil premium, to help close the attainment gap between those from the most deprived and the wealthiest backgrounds - from April next year schools will receive an extra £430 a year for every one of their pupils from the poorest backgrounds.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
