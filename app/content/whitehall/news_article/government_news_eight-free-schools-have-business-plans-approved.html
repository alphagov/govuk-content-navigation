        Michael Gove has today announced that 8 proposals to set up free schools have now progressed from business case and plan stage to the pre-opening stage - the final stage before opening.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Secretary of State for Education made the announcement when addressing the first ever national free schools conference, where he was joined by US education experts and teachers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The conference brings together ministers and more than 400 parents, teachers, charities and other groups from across the country that are planning to set up free schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 8 proposals include Stour Valley Community School in Suffolk, which was approved earlier this month.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other seven are based in London, West Sussex, Norwich and Leicester. They are:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         ARK Conway, Hammersmith and Fulham
        </li>
        <li>
         Discovery New School, West Sussex
        </li>
        <li>
         Etz Chaim, Barnet
        </li>
        <li>
         The Free School, Norwich
        </li>
        <li>
         I-Foundation, Leicester City
        </li>
        <li>
         St Luke’s Church of England Primary School, Camden
        </li>
        <li>
         Woodpecker Hall, Enfield
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Free schools will be set up by a wide range of proposers including charities, educational groups, teachers and groups of parents. They are set up in response to parental demand, and will improve choice and drive up standards for all young people regardless of their background. Free schools will enjoy the same freedoms and flexibilities as academies.
