        Following a competitive bidding process, the Department for Education has approved grant funding for New Schools Network (NSN) to provide pre-application support to parents, teachers and community groups and others hoping to open free schools. NSN is a registered charity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The grant will be a maximum of £400,000 for the remainder of this financial year (2011 to 2012), and a maximum of £650,000 in 2012 to 2013. There is an option to extend the grant for one year beyond this.
       </p>
       <p>
        The grant is expected to commence on 1 November 2011, subject to final negotiations on the grant agreement. This will be published in due course.
       </p>
       <p>
        The grant was awarded after a rigorous bid assessment conducted by senior Department for Education officials and an independent official from outside the Department.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some 40 groups requested information about how to bid for the grant, with two applications being made. NSN was judged to have submitted the strongest bid by a clear margin.
