      It’s been announced that next year’s National Apprenticeship Week will run from Monday, 9 March to Friday, 13 March 2015
     </p>
     <p>
      Apprenticeships are thriving in England and National Apprenticeship Week will celebrate Apprenticeships and the positive impact that they have on individuals, businesses and the wider economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Co-ordinated by the Skills Funding Agency, the week will include hundreds of events and activities across England.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers, apprentices, business support organisations, learning providers, colleges and schools across the land will be encouraged to support the Week by hosting activities to showcase the achievements and benefits of Apprenticeships.
     </p>
     <p>
      Skills Minister Nick Boles said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Apprenticeships deliver work for young people and adults, enabling them to earn while they learn in a real job, gaining a real qualification and a real future. They help businesses grow their own talent. Currently, more than 100,000 employers in England offer Apprenticeships in 200,000 locations, covering over 170 industries and 1500 different job roles.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       National Apprenticeship Week gets bigger and better each year and we are hoping that next year is no exception. We are once again looking forward to raising the profile of Apprenticeships and celebrating the important role they have in equipping people of all ages with the skills that they need to prosper in their lives.
      </p>
