        The focused inspections are part of a concerted programme of action by Ofsted to establish why children in some parts of the country have a much lower chance of attending a good or better school than their peers in other similar areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fifteen schools were inspected during the focused inspection period 13 to 22 May 2013, including 10 primary schools and 5 secondary schools. The schools were all due for inspection by the end of this academic year and selected to encompass a range of school types such as small schools, or voluntary aided schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the inspections, Ofsted also gathered information on the use, quality and impact of local authority support for school improvement by asking three additional key questions of headteachers and governors.

         On 17 January 2013, Ofsted announced the first wave of focused school inspections across local authority areas, where children are being denied the standard of education they deserve. The press release is available on the Ofsted website.
        </li>
        <li>
         Local authority areas were selected for the focused school inspection programme on the basis of the relative proportion of children attending good or better primary schools, as set out in the last Ofsted Annual Report, and Ofsted data on the proportion of children attending good or better secondary schools, as well as any relevant inspection evidence gathered during the autumn 2012 term. These are standard section 5 inspections, which were scheduled to take place this academic year and include all types of schools – although the majority will be primary schools.
        </li>
        <li>
         The most recent published data shows that in East Riding a child has a only 66% of chance of attending a good or better school compared with 79% for the rest of the country.
