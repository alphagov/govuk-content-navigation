      Dear Sir
     </p>
     <p>
      Contrary to your report (Cameron and Gove ‘failing to back headteachers over poor staff’, 5 June 2010) we are scrapping the General Teaching Council for England (GTC) precisely because it is not delivering what heads want. We do need to have an effective way of dealing with incompetence and misconduct and will be setting out which of GTC’s functions should be transferred to other bodies. In addition to the £400,000 grant mentioned, the taxpayer subsidises GTC membership by almost £16 million a year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Yours faithfully
     </p>
     <p>
      Lord Hill of Oareford
      <br>
       Schools Minister
      </br>
