      Skills and Apprenticeships Minister Robert Halfon said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Apprenticeships are a ladder of opportunity, giving young people and adults the chance they deserve to get on and fulfil their potential.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Congratulations to everyone that has taken part in the National Apprenticeship Awards so far and the winners representing the North West. They have demonstrated just how much businesses and learners can gain from an apprenticeship.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Sue Husband, director, National Apprenticeship Service, added:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The National Apprenticeship Awards enable talented apprentices and committed employers to receive the recognition they truly deserve. Our awards not only celebrate the achievements of apprentices and businesses alike but they also encourage others to get involved in apprenticeships.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Today’s winners are the best of the best in the North West. I congratulate each and every one of them on their success and for those heading to the national finals, the very best of luck.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
