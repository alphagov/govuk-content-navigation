      The National Apprenticeship Awards celebrated their eleventh anniversary in 2014 and the national event proved a great success with 700+ employers, apprentices, stakeholders, VIPs, sponsors and others attending the event at the LG Arena on 13 November 2014, as part of The Skills Show.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Deputy Prime Minister attended on the night and gave a key note speech as well as announcing the Top 100 Apprenticeship Employers for 2014. The prestigious list of employers is compiled in association with City and Guilds, and the only way to appear on the 2015 list is to submit an application for the National Apprenticeship Awards.
     </p>

      Guests were also joined by Imogen Shaw from ITV and Ziyad Patel from PwC, two current apprentices who feature in the

      learner campaign. Both spoke passionately about the benefits of becoming an apprentice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Planning is underway for the next awards cycle, and the timeline for entries, regional ceremonies and the national ceremony is being finalised. We hope that we will be able to communicate the timeline and further information later this month.
