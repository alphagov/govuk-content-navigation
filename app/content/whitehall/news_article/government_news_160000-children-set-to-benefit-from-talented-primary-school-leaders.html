      More than a hundred thousand children in challenging primary schools will receive extra help from specially trained teachers after Schools Minister David Laws announced £7.4 million to help develop primary school leaders of the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      The scheme – called Teaching Leaders Primary – sees primary teachers, or so called ‘middle leaders’, already working in challenging schools and with the potential to become outstanding leaders, put through a rigorous 2-year training programme which develops their skills and helps them get the most from pupils.
     </p>
     <p>
      A total of 160,000 children aged from 5 to 11 from disadvantaged backgrounds will benefit over the next 4 years. In its first year, the programme will be open to 1,200 primary teachers in London, Manchester and Birmingham, and also in specific areas of need – like Hull, Norfolk and Blackpool.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister David Laws said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       We know there is a strong link between school leadership, quality of teaching, and outcomes for pupils. Outstanding leadership is crucial in getting the most from pupils, and we know that this is increasingly important in primary schools.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       This funding will allow Teaching Leaders to expand their success with promising teachers in secondary schools to those at primary level. Now primary teachers with the potential to be outstanding heads will get the support they need to become the best school leaders of tomorrow.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      This forms part of the government’s drive to deliver the best schools and skills for young people so the next generation can succeed. In the growing diversity of the school system middle leaders play a vital role in supporting disadvantaged pupils and closing the attainment gap between them and their peers.

      of Teaching Leaders, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       High-quality middle leadership is the essential element to ensuring consistently excellent teaching in every classroom, which we know makes the greatest difference in closing the achievement gap for our most disadvantaged pupils. This funding means that we can work with middle leaders in the primary phase to address the achievement gap earlier in a child’s education.
      </p>

     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Teaching Leaders Primary is an exciting opportunity for primary middle leaders. The innovative, bespoke model designed specifically for and developed with school leaders in primary schools shows that Teaching Leaders understands middle leadership in primary and will bring real impact to schools in the most challenging contexts.
