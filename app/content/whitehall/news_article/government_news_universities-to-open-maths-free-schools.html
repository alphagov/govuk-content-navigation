      King’s College London and the University of Exeter plan to open the first specialist maths free schools in September 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The new specialist maths schools aim to bridge the gap between school and university maths, and demonstrate how new approaches can bring dramatic improvements in performance that can be applied more widely.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Autumn Statement 2011 announced the government’s intention to establish specialist maths free schools for 16- to 19-year-olds, supported by strong university maths departments and academics.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department invites interest from universities to open specialist maths free schools in September 2014 and beyond. Interested universities should contact the
      <a href="mailto:Angela.Webdale@education.gsi.gov.uk">
       specialist maths free school team
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Maths is a strategic priority in education and is at the heart of improving our society and economy. This country has some brilliant university maths departments and world-famous mathematicians, but they have become disconnected from schools, school curriculums and exams.
