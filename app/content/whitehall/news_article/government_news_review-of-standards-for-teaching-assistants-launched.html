        The review will aim to replace the current set of standards with a clearer and more concise version which reflects the diversity of the existing schools system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The review panel will aim to draw up standards which:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         are unequivocal, clear and easy to understand
        </li>
        <li>
         can be used to assess the performance of teaching assistants
        </li>
        <li>
         steer the professional development of teaching assistants at all levels
        </li>
        <li>
         are designed to inspire confidence in teaching assistants and ensure that schools use their skills and expertise to best effect
        </li>
        <li>
         focus primarily on the key elements of their professional relationship with teachers to ensure that all pupils attain the highest possible standards
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Kate Dethridge, Principal of Churchend Primary Academy, Reading, has been appointed to chair the review. She will be supported by a panel of experts with a diverse range of expertise.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mrs Dethridge is a serving member of the Department for Education’s
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/bureaucracy-reference-group">
         Bureaucracy Reference Group
        </a>
        , and a national leader of education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister David Laws said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Good teaching assistants are essential to driving up standards in the classroom and helping students fulfil their full potential.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Kate Dethridge and the expert panel supporting her will bring a wealth of experience to this review, which will help to ensure the continuing improvement of school standards under this government.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Kate Dethridge added:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         I welcome this opportunity to work with colleagues to write a set of standards to raise the status and professionalism of teaching assistants across our schools. We hope to ensure that the development of these standards will make a significant contribution to a self-improving, school-led system.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The review is expected to report back to the Secretary of State for Education in spring 2015.
