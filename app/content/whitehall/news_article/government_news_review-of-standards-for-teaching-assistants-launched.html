      The review will aim to replace the current set of standards with a clearer and more concise version which reflects the diversity of the existing schools system.
     </p>
     <p>
      The review panel will aim to draw up standards which:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       are unequivocal, clear and easy to understand
      </li>
      <li>
       can be used to assess the performance of teaching assistants
      </li>
      <li>
       steer the professional development of teaching assistants at all levels
      </li>
      <li>
       are designed to inspire confidence in teaching assistants and ensure that schools use their skills and expertise to best effect
      </li>
      <li>
       focus primarily on the key elements of their professional relationship with teachers to ensure that all pupils attain the highest possible standards
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Kate Dethridge, Principal of Churchend Primary Academy, Reading, has been appointed to chair the review. She will be supported by a panel of experts with a diverse range of expertise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mrs Dethridge is a serving member of the Department for Education’s
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/bureaucracy-reference-group">
       Bureaucracy Reference Group
      </a>
      , and a national leader of education.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister David Laws said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Good teaching assistants are essential to driving up standards in the classroom and helping students fulfil their full potential.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Kate Dethridge and the expert panel supporting her will bring a wealth of experience to this review, which will help to ensure the continuing improvement of school standards under this government.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Kate Dethridge added:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       I welcome this opportunity to work with colleagues to write a set of standards to raise the status and professionalism of teaching assistants across our schools. We hope to ensure that the development of these standards will make a significant contribution to a self-improving, school-led system.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The review is expected to report back to the Secretary of State for Education in spring 2015.
