        England rugby star Mike Brown has officially reopened his former school in Salisbury after it was transformed through the government’s flagship rebuilding programme.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Harlequins’ full back unveiled a plaque at a ceremony to mark the reopening of Wyvern College in a state-of-the-art new building following £9.3 million of construction work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wyvern College, an all-boys secondary school in Laverstock, is 1 of 16 schools across the South West to be rebuilt through the £4.4 billion
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/priority-school-building-programme-psbp">
         priority school building programme
        </a>
        (
        <abbr title="priority school building programme">
         PSBP
        </abbr>
        ), which is transforming some of the most run-down schools in the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of the construction work, the school now benefits from new, modern classrooms, as well as a refurbished sports block and science facilities. There are also additional pupil places, which comes with help from Wiltshire county council investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister Lord Nash said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Our investment in school buildings across the country is transforming the learning environment for tens of thousands of pupils and their teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reopening of Wyvern College is a key milestone for the priority school building programme  in the South West.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Ensuring all children have access to the best possible schools and facilities is just one part of our commitment to help all young people reach their potential regardless of their background. These buildings will provide modern, fit-for-purpose schools for pupils for many years to come.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Paul German, Headteacher of Wyvern College, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Wyvern pupils and staff are delighted to have moved into fantastic, purpose built, 21st-century accommodation. The completion of this project marks the culmination of many years of hope and aspiration alongside the dedicated hard work of a large group of people.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         For many years, pupils and staff have endured dilapidated and inadequate accommodation. This new build marks a huge investment in our school, the future and for boys’ education in Salisbury. Thanks to drive, determination and vision, with the expertise of Kier Group, we have a wonderful legacy and can face the future with huge confidence.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Trevor White, Operations Director of Kier, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Working on Wyvern College has been a challenging but very enjoyable project and it will offer a first-class learning environment for pupils. We have a wealth of experience in delivering educational facilities across the UK and we’re looking forward to working on further projects throughout the programme to provide much-needed additional school places.

        Thanks to the

        <abbr title="priority school building programme">

        , with projects costing around a third less.

         Thanks to decisions which have been taken to improve efficiency and reduce waste, significant work on those projects is already underway. In November, 11 buildings are re-opening through
