        The National Education Director of one of the country’s leading multi-academy trusts has been appointed as the new Regional Schools Commissioner for the South West of England.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rebecca Clark, National Education Director and South West Regional Director for Oasis Community Learning, will be responsible for overseeing the growth of academies in the region and will monitor their performance to ensure children receive the best possible education. She is taking over from Sir David Carter, who was recently appointed National Schools Commissioner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rebecca will start on 3 May and will work closely with Sir David Carter and Education Secretary Nicky Morgan to shape the role and priorities of the growing numbers of academies in the region.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I am absolutely delighted to be appointed as the next Regional Schools Commissioner for the South West. To have the opportunity to build upon the strong foundations established by Sir David Carter in a region where I went to school and now live and work is a huge privilege and a great responsibility.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         There is real strength and opportunity in the South West. I believe that every leader holds a collective responsibility for ensuring that every child across our region receives their entitlement to an excellent education. I look forward to bringing my experience of harnessing effective collaboration between leaders and teachers both regionally and nationally to my new role. It is only by working together in the interests of all schools and all children that we will ensure that the South West is an excellent place to lead, to teach and to educate a child.
        </p>
       </blockquote>

        <p>
         Rebecca Clark has years of experience as a teacher, headteacher and senior academy trust executive in schools across the South West. I am delighted to appoint someone of her calibre to one of the most important roles in the education system.
        </p>

         I know she will use her experience and expertise to boost standards in schools across the South West and I look forward to working closely with her.
