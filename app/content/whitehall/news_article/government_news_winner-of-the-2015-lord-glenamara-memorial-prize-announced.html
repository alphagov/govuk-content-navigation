        Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         George is clearly a well-rounded young man whose outstanding academic achievements and wider contribution to his school and local community make him a deserving winner of the Lord Glenamara Memorial Prize and a shining example for others.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         I would also like to congratulate the other nominees, who were hugely impressive and made the final decision very difficult for our panel of judges.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Reacting to his award, George said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I am honoured and thrilled to win this wonderful award. I would like to acknowledge the support given to me by my teachers, friends and family and would like to thank everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am passionate for young people to be supported and educated at school on mental health and wellbeing, and I want to use this prize to promote this. When young people are properly supported, they cope better, learn better, and become more resilient.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         I will continue to encourage others to learn increasingly important languages, such as Mandarin.
        </p>
