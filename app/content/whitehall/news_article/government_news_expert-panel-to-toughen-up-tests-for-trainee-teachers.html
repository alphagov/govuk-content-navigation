      Around one in five fail current basic literacy and numeracy tests first time round.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tests that trainee teachers have to sit are to be reviewed by a panel of outstanding head teachers and education experts so all new teachers have the basic skills needed to be great teachers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Trainee teachers currently have to pass skills tests in literacy and numeracy. However, they only take the tests after starting their training course and they are allowed unlimited re-sits.
     </p>
     <p>
      New figures show that around one in five trainees fail either of the basic tests first time round. Around one in 10 trainees has to take the numeracy test three times or more to pass.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Government set out last year, in the ‘Training our next generation of outstanding teachers’ strategy, its plans to raise the quality of trainee teachers in England to match the best-performing countries in the world. In order to attract top graduates into teaching, they will be offered bursaries of up £20,000 to train as teachers.
     </p>
     <p>
      In line with this, the skills tests will be strengthened so that they are testing candidates to meet rigorous standards of literacy and numeracy. The new tests will be introduced in September 2013 for trainees who are starting training from 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The review will be undertaken by the Skills Test Review Group, chaired by Sally Coates, Principal at Burlington Danes Academy in west London, who chaired the Review of Teachers’ Standards. They will also seek the views of advisers from across the world of education on how these tests should be developed to be more demanding. The Review Group will report to Ministers by the end of June 2012, in time for the introduction of new tests in September 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the tests are being reviewed, from this September the pass mark for the current tests will be raised. Trainees who fail one or both of the skills tests at the first attempt will be limited to two re-sits for each test. They will also have to pass the test before starting their course, so those without the right skills cannot start the training.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       International studies show that rigorous selection of trainee teachers is key to raising the quality and standing of the teaching profession. It helps ensure trainees are committed to becoming teachers.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Strengthened trainee tests and an end to constant re-sits will mean parents can be confident that all teachers have the basic skills needed.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Teachers not only need great subject knowledge, they also need high levels of literacy and numeracy, strong interpersonal and communication skills, a willingness to learn and a motivation to teach. All these are characteristics of effective teachers.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The current tests include questions such as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       For a practical task a primary teacher needs 25 millilitres of liquid for each pupil. There are 28 pupils in the class. How many millilitres of liquid are needed? [Answer: 700 millilitres]
      </li>
      <li>
       Teachers organised activities for three classes of 24 pupils and four classes of 28 pupils. What was the total number of pupils involved? [Answer: 184 pupils]
      </li>
      <li>
       Nadine was
       <strong>
        __
       </strong>
       ___ that she had passed her Geography examination. Is the correct word: releived, relieved, releaved or realived? [Answer: relieved]
      </li>
      <li>
       Apart from the
       <strong>
        __
       </strong>
       ___ details, the art lesson was truly inspired. Is the correct word: administrative, adminstrative, administretive or adminstretive? [Answer: administrative]
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Sally Coates, chair of the Skills Test Review Group, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       It’s important for all teachers to have high standards of literacy and numeracy themselves, whatever they teach.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       That’s why I’m delighted to lead this review of skills testing, to make sure that all new teachers have these vital skills.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Stephen Hillier, chief executive at the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       The review will identify the core skills and knowledge that all teachers need if they are to deliver high quality lessons and progress in their careers.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The new tests build on our strategy to create an outstanding teaching force, which includes large bursary payments for top graduates and courses to boost trainees’ knowledge. This is what parents expect and children deserve.

     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        Remit of the Skills Test Review Group: To advise Ministers on the development of more demanding tests for entry to teacher training so that all candidates must demonstrate the rigorous standards of literacy, numeracy, and other intellectual skills necessary to become a teacher. Recommendations should cover the content, level of difficulty and means of assessment for the new tests. The review should bear in mind the need for cost effectiveness in any new testing system introduced. It should report to Ministers by the end of June 2012, in time for the introduction of new tests in September 2013.
