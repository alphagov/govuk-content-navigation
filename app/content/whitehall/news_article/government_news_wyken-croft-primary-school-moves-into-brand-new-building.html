        Wyken Croft Primary School in Coventry had its official reopening ceremony today, following a multi-million pound rebuild.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school’s existing dilapidated building has been completely rebuilt as part of the government’s £2.4 billion Priority School Building Programme (
        <abbr title="Priority School Building Programme">
         PSBP
        </abbr>
        ) to address 260 of the schools in England in the worst condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wyken Croft Primary School is the third school in Coventry to open in new buildings under the
        <abbr title="Priority School Building Programme">
         PSBP
        </abbr>
        . In total, 7 schools are being rebuilt across the city. Wyken Croft joins

        Thanks to the

        , pupils and staff will now benefit from a new £7.1 million, 2-storey, fit-for-purpose rebuild comprising:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         new classrooms
        </li>
        <li>
         large dining-hall area
        </li>
        <li>
         state-of-the-art kitchen facilities
        </li>
        <li>
         a new nursery
        </li>
        <li>
         a new centre that offers before- and after-school clubs
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Schools Minister David Laws said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The official opening of the new building for Wyken Croft Primary School is a fantastic achievement.  This is the third school in Coventry to open as part of the Priority School Building Programme.
        </p>
        <p>
         Delivering great new schools will help to build a stronger economy and a fairer society, so that every young person can get on in life. Vital building work is taking place at schools in the worst state across the country. We are making excellent progress with 14 school buildings now complete and all 260 schools projects due for completion by the end of 2017.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         I hope the new school facilities will provide an inspirational learning environment that will encourage every student to reach their full potential.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        An event was held yesterday to mark the official opening of the school. The rebuild was completed in just over 12 months. This was all made possible by a successful partnership between the school, Coventry city council, the Education Funding Agency (
        <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
         EFA
        </abbr>
        ) and the contractor, Wates Construction.
       </p>
       <p>
        Derek Gardiner, Executive Headteacher at Wyken Croft Primary School, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Wyken Croft has a long and proud history stretching back over 60 years. We now have an outstanding new building with excellent facilities, which we hope will serve both the children and community of Wyken just as proudly in helping to further enhance their achievement and progress.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Richard Scarrott, Wates Business Unit Director, Midlands, commented:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         The Education Funding Agency’s Priority School Building Programme is above all about creating amazing spaces to allow young people to be creative, learn and flourish, but this comes with the added need to keep a keen eye on the speed of construction whilst ensuring value for money is delivered.
        </p>
       </blockquote>

        The government is determined to raise the standard of schools and the education they provide as part of its plan for education. The
        <abbr title="Priority School Building Programme">
         PSBP
        </abbr>
        is building on the progress already made in delivering a more efficient, faster and less bureaucratic approach to building schools.

        <li>
         59 schools are currently under construction
        </li>
        <li>
         all 260 schools are due for completion by the end of 2017 – 2 years earlier than originally planned
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Given the success of the
        <abbr title="Priority School Building Programme">

        , the government has announced a second phase of the programme, worth around £2 billion. Applications are currently being considered and successful applicants will be confirmed by the end of the year.
