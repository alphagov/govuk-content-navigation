        Children’s Rights Director Roger Morgan has not added his views to
        <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/childrens-views-restraint-2012" rel="external">
         the report
        </a>
        , he has used direct quotes from the 94 children he and his team spoke to as part of the consultation. Overall children agreed that restraint should only be used as a last resort. Every group said staff should always try to calm things down before things get too bad that restraint is needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Children’s Rights Director, Roger Morgan said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         A common theme emerging from discussions included children warning that restraint itself can ‘wind people up’ and thereby pose the risk of making things worse rather than improving behaviour. One discussion group told us that in their experience staff did not want to restrain children and where staff had been properly trained, less restraint happened because training gave staff skills in calming children down. Importantly though, children were clear that there are times when – rarely - restraint is necessary, to prevent someone getting injured, or to prevent property getting seriously damaged.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        When asked what could trigger the need for using restraint the two most common reasons were damaging property and hitting someone. Other reasons included trying to cause a riot, trying to throw a chair, trying to use a knife to stab someone, losing their temper, trying to run away and refusing to go to school.
       </p>
       <p>
        When children were asked what rules should be imposed on uses of restraint they said, the most important thing was to let children calm down first, before using restraint. They also advised to stop restraint if it is becoming too painful and not use restraint for too long and it interferes with someone’s breathing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Children also expressed that staff should know whether a child has been sexually abused and take this into account when deciding whether to use restraint or not.
       </p>
       <p>
        All our groups agreed that restraint shouldn’t be used on disabled children or young people with medical issues such as asthma and children who have been sexually abused.
