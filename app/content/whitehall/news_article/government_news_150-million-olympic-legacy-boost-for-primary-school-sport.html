        Primary school sport is set to be transformed thanks to a £150 million a year boost that will improve coaching for the youngest pupils and inspire the Olympic and Paralympic stars of the future, the

       </p>
       <p>
        The new sports funding aims to improve the quality of provision by providing:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          A lump sum for each school, with a per-pupil top-up. A typical primary school with 250 primary aged pupils would receive £9,250 per year
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          ‘Ring-fenced’ funding that’s only to be spent on sport which will go directly into the hands of heads and teachers
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          A greater role for Britain’s best sporting and voluntary organisations, including National Governing Bodies who will increase the specialist coaching and skills development on offer for primary schools
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Tougher assessment of sport provision via Ofsted to ensure the funding is bringing the maximum benefit for all pupils, with schools held to account for how they spend the money
         </p>

        <li>
         <p>
          Sport England investing £1.5 million a year of lottery funding through the County Sport partnerships to help Primary Schools link up with local sports coaches, clubs and sports governing bodies
         </p>
        </li>

        Prime Minister David Cameron said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         The Olympic and Paralympic Games marked an incredible year for this country and I will always be proud that we showed the world what Britain can do. I want to ensure the Games count for the future too and that means capitalising on the inspiration young people took from what they saw during those summer months.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         With this new approach to sport, we can create a culture in our schools that encourages all children to be active and enjoy sport, and helps foster the aspirations of future Olympians and Paralympians. Whether that is the future Jessica Ennis, Ellie Simmonds or Mo Farah, or someone who will simply learn to love sport and exercise for a lifetime, this investment will benefit a whole generation of children for many years to come.
        </p>
       </blockquote>

        The new support for primary school is funded by the

        Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Maria Miller said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         This funding will give primary school children fantastic sport, and is the final piece in the 2012 sports legacy jigsaw. It complements our £1 billion youth and community sport strategy that is increasing opportunities for secondary school children to play more sport. I am very pleased that sports’ governing bodies are backing this move, which will help create a in this country where people play sport for life.
