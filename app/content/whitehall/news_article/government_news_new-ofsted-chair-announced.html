      Secretary of State for Education Nicky Morgan today announced the appointment of David Hoare as the next chair of Ofsted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Hoare, currently chairman of the Teenage Cancer Trust, will take up his post in September.
     </p>
     <p>
      His background in leading successful organisations and his experience in driving change made him the outstanding candidate.

      He will replace Baroness Sally Morgan, who has been chair since 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I am delighted to appoint David to this important role.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a proven business leader who has the expertise in leadership and governance crucial to helping Ofsted through a significant period of change and reform.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is also passionate about education and his work with academies across the country shows he shares my commitment to ever higher standards in our schools, for all children but particularly the most disadvantaged.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       I am confident that his strong track record in business and the passion he demonstrated throughout the interview process will be of huge benefit to Ofsted. He and Sir Michael Wilshaw will make a superb team.
      </p>

       I look forward to working closely with Sir Michael Wilshaw to raise quality in children’s services and standards in our schools and colleges - especially for disadvantaged pupils.

       Ofsted has a key role helping to improve the leadership of our schools and the performance of our pupils.
