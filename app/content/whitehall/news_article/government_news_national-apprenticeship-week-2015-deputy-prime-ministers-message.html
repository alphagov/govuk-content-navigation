      Every young person has the talent and potential to succeed and, since 2010, more than 2 million young people have set out to achieve their dreams through an apprenticeship.
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/national-apprenticeship-week-2015">
       National Apprenticeship Week
      </a>
      gives us an opportunity to recognise the incredible achievements of these Apprentices. It also enables us to thank the thousands of British employers giving them this chance to earn and learn. And inspire more young people, businesses and organisations to get involved.
     </p>
     <p>
      So whether you want to work in TV production, legal services, engineering or elsewhere: whatever your professional interests, there’s a high-quality apprenticeship available to help you develop the skills that you need.
     </p>
     <p>
      And, whatever your sector, there’s a hard-working, dedicated apprentice out there ready to help your organisation thrive.
     </p>
     <p>
      The facts speak for themselves.
     </p>
     <p>
      More apprentices than ever are making it into our top professions – with research showing that a fifth of all advanced apprentices progress to Higher Education and that gaining a higher-level apprenticeship can boost your lifetime earnings by £150,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many employers tell us that taking on an apprentice has benefited their business.
     </p>
     <p>
      We’re working as hard as we can to ensure Britain’s economy has the skills it needs for the future, with over 1,000 businesses, of all sizes and sectors helping to design top-quality apprenticeships as part of our

       Trailblazer scheme
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      But you can make the difference. Help us build on this success. So, if you want a good career or a boost to your businesses’ bottom line – get an apprenticeship.
