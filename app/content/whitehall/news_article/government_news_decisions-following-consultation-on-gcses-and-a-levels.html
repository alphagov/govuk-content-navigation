         <p>
          Ofqual has previously confirmed that new AS and A level qualifications will not be tiered, and that new GCSEs should only be tiered where a single set of assessments cannot in a valid and manageable way assess students across the full ability range. None of the GCSEs included in today’s announcement will be tiered.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Ofqual has finalised the

        Ofqual and the DfE have also recently consulted in parallel on the content and assessment arrangements for a further group of qualifications planned for first teaching in September 2016. These are:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         <p>
          GCSEs in: citizenship studies, cooking and nutrition, design and technology, drama and religious studies.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          AS qualifications and A levels in: drama and theatre, and religious studies.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The results of this consultation will be announced in February 2015.

       <p>
        *The existing regulatory requirements for assessment in these subjects were not designed to our current definition of non-exam assessment. Instead they were determined by the amount of ‘internal’ and ‘external’ assessment permitted. Therefore, when we describe the current weighting of non-exam assessment, we refer to the amount of assessment that is seen or could be permitted in current qualifications and which falls under our definition of non-exam assessment.
