      <li>
       <p>
        Ofqual has previously confirmed that new AS and A level qualifications will not be tiered, and that new GCSEs should only be tiered where a single set of assessments cannot in a valid and manageable way assess students across the full ability range. None of the GCSEs included in today’s announcement will be tiered.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Ofqual has finalised the

      Ofqual and the DfE have also recently consulted in parallel on the content and assessment arrangements for a further group of qualifications planned for first teaching in September 2016. These are:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>
        GCSEs in: citizenship studies, cooking and nutrition, design and technology, drama and religious studies.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        AS qualifications and A levels in: drama and theatre, and religious studies.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        The results of this consultation will be announced in February 2015.

     <p>
      *The existing regulatory requirements for assessment in these subjects were not designed to our current definition of non-exam assessment. Instead they were determined by the amount of ‘internal’ and ‘external’ assessment permitted. Therefore, when we describe the current weighting of non-exam assessment, we refer to the amount of assessment that is seen or could be permitted in current qualifications and which falls under our definition of non-exam assessment.
