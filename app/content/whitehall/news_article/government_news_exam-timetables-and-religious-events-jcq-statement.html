      This statement was released by the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) on 7 January 2016:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       There has been a clear misunderstanding in some parts of the media as to how the GCSE and A level timetable is set and the impact religious events, such as Ramadan, Easter and Passover, have on it.  It is important to note that the timetable for 2016 was drafted over a year ago, is published, and won’t be changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each year the timetable is reviewed to ensure it meets the current needs of students,  schools and colleges. This review includes a consultation and considers comments from a wide range of stakeholders including schools, colleges and religious groups. However, each year there are only minimal changes.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       In such a large, complex system where there is a large number of candidates taking examinations and a diverse range of subjects available, it is not always possible to meet each and every request. Exam boards will always aim to be as fair as possible to all.  If a small change can be made for any one group that does not impact negatively on most students, it will, quite rightly, be considered – but these are made before the timetable is published.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
