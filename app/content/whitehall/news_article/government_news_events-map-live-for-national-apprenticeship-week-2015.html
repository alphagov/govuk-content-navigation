      National Apprenticeship Week runs from 9 to 13 March, and all over the country businesses, schools, colleges and training organisations will be holding events and hosting activities.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, Ministers, MPs and senior government managers will be out and about throughout the week taking part in as many events as they can, visiting businesses and talking to apprentices.
     </p>
     <p>
      We are using our
      <a href="http://nas.apprenticeships.org.uk/awards/apprenticeship-week-2015/events-map.aspx" rel="external">
       online events map
      </a>
      again to track all of this exciting activity, so you can see at glance what is going on near you.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you are running an event for National Apprenticeship Week, why not submit information using our
      <a href="http://nas.apprenticeships.org.uk/awards/apprenticeship-week-2015/eventform.aspx" rel="external">
       online form
      </a>
      so that we can include it on the map and let everyone else know what you are doing?
     </p>
     <p>
      The objective of National Apprenticeship Week 2015 is to increase awareness and take-up of apprenticeships and traineeships and the overarching theme for National Apprenticeship Week 2015 is a challenge to us all to think about how much we really know about apprenticeships.
