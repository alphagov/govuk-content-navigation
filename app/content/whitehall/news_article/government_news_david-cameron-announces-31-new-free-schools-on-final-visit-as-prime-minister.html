     <p>
      The Prime Minister today announced 31 new free schools providing around 20,000 high-quality places across the country.
     </p>
     <p>
      On his final visit as Prime Minister David Cameron today travelled to Reach Academy in Feltham, west London, an outstanding-rated school set up by teachers using freedoms provided by government reforms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prime Minster David Cameron said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Free schools have been at the heart of this government’s education reforms which have seen more than 1.4 million more children in good or outstanding schools since 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
       More than 300 have been created since I became Prime Minister and 200 are set to open meaning tens of thousands more young people, many from disadvantaged areas, finally have a choice of a good education that helps them reach their full potential.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       I am proud of what this government has achieved, working with heads and teachers to raise standards so that our young people have the best possible start in life.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The 31 schools comprise successful applications from some of the best academy trusts in the country. They include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        Kings Leadership Padgate, Warrington – this new school is being set up by the team behind King’s leadership academy in Warrington which last year won the national award for character education. The new school will have a similar curriculum and aims to offer high quality education in an area with a number of poor-performing schools
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        The Avenue, north west London – the school will cater for pupils with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and complex needs. It is being set up by the Brent Specialist Academy Trust, established by 3 special schools all with good or outstanding ratings from Ofsted
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Reach Academy 2, Hounslow – the second school from Reach will take its inspiration from the Harlem Children’s Zone (HCZ) in New York City – the school will replicate HCZ’s focus on early intervention with 2- and 3-year-olds with strong relationships with families via home visits and integrated family support
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The successful applicants will now begin to confirm sites with many due to open by September 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      The free schools programme provides greater local choice for parents by setting up new schools and driving up standards. Around half have been set up in deprived communities and 1 in 4 has been rated outstanding by Ofsted – above the national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many have used their freedoms to extend the school day, allowing them to offer more extra-curricular activities to pupils while others have used their freedoms to offer high-quality teaching in areas including maths, science and languages.
     </p>
     <h2 id="notes">
      Notes
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Reach Academy Feltham opened in September 2012. The school has 840 pupils and was inspected by Ofsted in March 2014 and was judged to be outstanding in all areas. This was the first all-through free school to be awarded the grade. The school is heavily oversubscribed and is situated in an area of high deprivation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 31 school applications announced today were approved as part of a fast-track process. Further successful applications will be announced in the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today there are 5,188 academies, 304 free schools, 40 studio schools and 39 university technical colleges more than in May 2010 – giving every child the chance to go to a good local school.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are now more good or outstanding schools than ever before, with over 1.4 million more pupils taught in good or outstanding schools than 2010.
