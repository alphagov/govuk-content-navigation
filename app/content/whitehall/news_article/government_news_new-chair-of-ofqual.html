         Amanda is an extremely talented and hugely experienced individual whose skills are perfectly suited to this high-profile post. I am delighted she is keen to take the role. She will make sure Ofqual is a strong regulator which holds our exam boards to account and ensures our qualifications are as rigorous as the best in the world.

        Amanda Spielman said:

       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Ofqual has an extremely important role in our education system. I am honoured to be considered for the role and I hope to ensure that it sustains its focus and rigour, in maintaining standards and in the regulation of awarding bodies.

        Ms Spielman is research and development director of the academy operator ARK Schools, where she is also responsible for legal, governance and regulatory matters. She was a member of the Sykes review panel commissioned by Michael Gove to review the school assessment system. She is also a chartered accountant and spent more than 15 years in private equity, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate strategy in the UK and the US for Kleinwort Benson, Mercer Management Consulting and Nomura International Principal Finance Group.

        The previous Chair and Chief Regulator was Kathleen Tattersall, who left her post last year. In the interim, deputy chair Sandra Burslem has taken on many of the responsibilities, supported by the chief executive, Glenys Stacey. Ms Spielman, whose appointment is subject to confirmation by Her Majesty at the next Privy Council meeting, is due to start at Ofqual later this summer. The education select committee has waived its right to hold a pre-appointment hearing.

         <p>
          Recruitment for a new Chair began last year. The appointments process was run in accordance with the Code of Practice issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) and the appointment made on merit; political activity played no part in the decision-making process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations and the code of practice, there is a requirement for appointeesâ€™ political activity (if any declared), and other information, to be made public. Ms Spielman declared no such activity.

          Ofqual - the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation - was established in 2010 following two years operating in an interim form. It regulates qualifications, exams and assessments in England and vocational qualifications in Northern Ireland. It ensures that children, young people and adult learners achieve the results their work deserves and that standards are safeguarded.
