      The
      <a href="http://naw.pledgeometer.net/EventPage" rel="external">
       Pledge-o-meter
      </a>
      is designed to record the commitments employers make to take on apprentices and trainees, with commitments pledged from now and until the end of National Apprenticeship Week 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      National Apprenticeship Week runs from 14 to 18 March and this year the Week will celebrate how apprenticeships can help individuals and businesses plan and achieve their ambitions of ‘rising to the top’.
Activity will showcase apprenticeship progression and opportunity by demonstrating the diverse apprenticeship offer, from traineeships right through to higher and degree apprenticeships.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hosted by the National Apprenticeship Service, the Pledge-o-meter has been developed by a team that includes two apprentices, Luke and Jordan, and encourages employers to
      <a href="http://naw.pledgeometer.net/" rel="external">
       publicly share their new commitments
      </a>
      to taking on more apprentices and trainees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last year businesses pledged 23,000 apprenticeships during National Apprenticeship Week, an increase from 20,000 the previous year. This year we want to encourage even more businesses to
      <a href="http://naw.pledgeometer.net" rel="external">
       share their pledges
      </a>
      using our online
      <a href="http://naw.pledgeometer.net/EventPage" rel="external">
       Pledge-o-meter

      . Use
      <a href="http://naw.pledgeometer.net/" rel="external">
       our online form
      </a>
      to submit your pledges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers including Adecco who have pledged 50 apprentices, Sellafield who pledged 165 and Deloitte who pledged 200 have got this year’s Pledge-o-meter numbers off to a great start.
