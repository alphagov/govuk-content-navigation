I congratulate each and every member of Squad UK and look forward to hearing about their preparations for 2017’s competition in Abu Dhabi.

      <p class="last-child">
       By competing in the WorldSkills Competition, the UK is able to share best practice in apprenticeships, further education and skills, with countries around the world, raising standards on a global scale. Additionally, by using the knowledge gained from competing at WorldSkills, we know we are working to international benchmarks that will ultimately equip more young people to help UK business better compete globally.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Members of Squad UK will now participate in a training and development programme which will include the selection of Team UK ahead of WorldSkills Abu Dhabi 2017. The development programme will include a series of milestones and benchmarks which Squad UK competitors must achieve to progress.
