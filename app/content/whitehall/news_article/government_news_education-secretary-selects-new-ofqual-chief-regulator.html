      The Secretary of State for Education, Nicky Morgan, has today (8 March 2016)
      <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/education-committee/news-parliament-2015/ofqual-pre-appointment-hearing-15-16/" rel="external">
       written to the Education Select Committee
      </a>
      recommending Sally Collier as the preferred candidate for the post of Ofqual Chief Regulator. Sally brings considerable experience of working across government and is a proven leader and
      <abbr title="chief executive officer">
       CEO
      </abbr>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The recommendation follows an extensive recruitment campaign carried out in line with the
      <a href="http://publicappointmentscommissioner.independent.gov.uk/the-code-of-practice/" rel="external">
       Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments’ (OCPA) Code
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary of State has now asked Neil Carmichael MP, Chair of the Education Select Committee to hold a
      <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/education-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/ofqual-chief-regulator-pre-appointment-15-16/" rel="external">
       pre-appointment hearing with Ms Collier
      </a>
      . This will take place at 9.30am on Wednesday 16 March, after which the committee will publish a short report on its opinion of the candidate’s suitability for the position.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Chief Regulator post is a Crown Appointment and the appointment will not be confirmed until an order is laid by Privy Council.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sally Collier will replace the current Ofqual Chief Regulator, Dame Glenys Stacey, who held the post since 2010 and who stepped down at the end of February.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pending the permanent appointment, Amanda Spielman, the Chair of Ofqual’s board, has taken on an ‘Interim Chief Regulator’ role, assuming the majority of the Chief Regulator’s responsibilities. Jeremy Benson, Executive Director Vocational Qualifications, has assumed the Accounting Officer role.
