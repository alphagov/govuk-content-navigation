      The Department has published national projections for the number of pupils in schools up to 2018.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Department for Education spokeswoman said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       We know that many schools across the country face real concerns about how to provide every child with a school place when in some areas, school places far outweigh rising demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are better targeting capital investment so that areas facing the highest demand for primary school places have the resources they need.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       This is why we are committed to providing £500 million to help local authorities provide extra school places to meet the extra pressures caused by increased birth rates. This funding is on top of £800m annually given to local authorities specifically to meet demand.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
