      The Prime Minister’s Apprenticeship Adviser, Nadhim Zahawi MP, Skills Minister, Nick Boles and just under 100 MPs have kick-started a ‘100 in 100 apprenticeship campaign’, at an event held at Portcullis House in London.
     </p>
     <p>
      Building on the government’s commitment to 3m apprenticeship starts by 2020, the campaign will see MPs across all political parties in England, securing apprenticeship pledges from businesses in their constituencies, with the aim of creating at least 100 new apprenticeships within the next 100 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      Already over 400 apprenticeship places have been promised by international employers, including

      Skills Minister, Nick Boles said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Apprenticeships are set to be one of the success stories of the decade. They deliver for business, our economy and offer life-changing opportunities for our young people. That’s exactly why we are committed to 3 million apprenticeships by 2020.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       I am greatly encouraged to see so many MPs become apprenticeship champions and would urge even more to go out and encourage employers in their constituencies to create 100 apprenticeships in 100 days.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The Prime Minister’s apprenticeship adviser, Nadhim Zahawi MP said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Now is the time for MPs from across the political spectrum to build on the growing momentum behind apprenticeships across their local constituencies. I am heartened by the optimism from businesses to create better products and greater services as a result of employing highly-skilled apprentices. Equally, local MPs can play their part by highlighting how apprenticeship opportunities can open doors for young people in their favoured careers.
