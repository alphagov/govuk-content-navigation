        The awards, now in their twelfth year, are run by the National Apprenticeship Service and recognise excellence in two areas: businesses that grow their own talent with apprentices and apprentices who have made a significant contribution to their workplaces.
       </p>
       <p>
        Skills Minister Nick Boles said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Congratulations to BAE Systems for your success at the National Apprenticeship Awards. Apprenticeships truly are set to be one of the great success stories of the decade, and BAE Systems is a worthy ambassador.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         We are committed to 3 million apprenticeships by 2020 so that even more businesses can follow BAE Systems’ lead and reap the benefits of apprenticeships.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Employment Minister Priti Patel said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to BAE Systems for their fantastic achievement in being named Macro Employer of the Year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Apprenticeships offer a fantastic way for many young people of all backgrounds to earn as they learn while providing employers with the transferable skills needed to take their business from strength to strength. We currently have record-breaking levels of employment – and this is boosted by prospects like apprenticeships. I want to see this continue.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         By working closely with businesses and taking steps like rolling out our ‘Jobcentre Plus Support for Schools’ programme to teach pupils about work experience, apprenticeships and traineeships, we are helping to create an even more flexible and resilient labour market for the future.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The company was chosen as the winner in recognition of its commitment to developing young people through apprenticeships.
       </p>
       <p>
        BAE Systems is a global defence, aerospace and security company employing around 84,000 people worldwide, with approximately 32,800 in the UK. The company takes on and solves customers` most urgent and complex engineering and technical challenges. Crucially, it maintains a technological edge to deliver and support the most advanced aircraft, submarines and ships, security systems combat vehicles and munitions. Developing a pipeline of highly skilled employees through apprenticeships is critical to the company’s future success.
       </p>
       <p>
        With over 1500 UK apprentices in learning at any one time, the company has significant plans for growth, averaging 2000 by 2018. In 2015 it had its highest UK intake ever of more than 780 apprentices, with around 600 new apprentice starts in England, a 40% increase from 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        On accepting the award, Steve Fogg, Managing Director, Shared Services, BAE Systems said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The key organisational benefit from our apprenticeship investment is meeting our future skills need. For complex technology requirements we simply cannot recruit all from the marketplace.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some 87% of graduating apprentices from the last 10 years are still working within the business, 38% promoted at least once, demonstrating a clear link to how the apprenticeship programme strengthens our workforce capabilities and provides business leaders.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Our apprenticeships benefit BAE Systems, providing a critical talent pipeline of motivated and qualified individuals. The apprentice benefits through above average remuneration whilst training with real career opportunities.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Nadhim Zahawi, the Prime Minister’s Apprenticeship Adviser, who presented the awards, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister has set a commitment of 3 million apprenticeship starts by 2020 and I am excited to have a role in helping to deliver this goal, while pushing to revolutionise the skills of our workforce in Britain. Good quality apprenticeships create a fairer society by giving hard working young people the chance to aim for their dream job whilst playing their part in building a stronger economy for Britain.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         There are many examples of excellent apprenticeships and apprentices in England and these winners are the best of the best. I congratulate BAE systems on their success. It’s an honour to have been part of these awards; to play a small part in recognising the effort of so many great businesses and to reward apprentices for their hard work and dedication. All this year’s winners should shout from the rooftops about what taking an apprenticeship has done for them or what hiring an apprentice has done for their business. I am determined that apprenticeships should be given the recognition they deserve, because they absolutely do deserve it.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The ceremony also saw BAE Systems named in the prestigious
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/national-apprenticeship-award-winners-announced">

        </a>
        . The list, which is compiled annually by the National Apprenticeship Service, sponsored by City &amp; Guilds, recognises excellence in businesses that employ apprentices.
       </p>
       <p>
        David Pamplin, Director, BT Academy, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I would like to congratulate BAE Systems on winning the Macro Employer of the Year at this year’s National Apprenticeship Awards. At BT, we know that our apprentices bring innovation, fresh ideas and energy to the company. They have a hugely positive impact towards developing a motivated, skilled and qualified workforce.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         The National Apprenticeship Awards showcase and recognise the many benefits that apprenticeships bring to individuals and businesses and inspire others to follow, enabling them to lead successful lives and drive economic growth in England and Wales.
