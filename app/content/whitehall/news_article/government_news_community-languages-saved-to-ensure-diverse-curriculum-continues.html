        Government action means
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
         GCSEs
        </abbr>
        and
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Education Advanced Level">
         A levels
        </abbr>
        in a range of community languages such as Panjabi, Portuguese and Japanese are to continue to ensure young people can carry on studying a diverse range of foreign languages.
       </p>
       <p>
        The news, announced today (22 April 2016) by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, marks a significant step for the government in its efforts to extend opportunity to young people and equip them with the skills they need in what is an increasingly global economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        It follows a government commitment in 2015 to protect a number of language
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
         GCSEs
        </abbr>
        and
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Education Advanced Level">
         A levels
        </abbr>
        after the exam boards announced that from 2017 they would be withdrawing several courses. In May 2015, the Secretary of State for Education wrote to the exam boards during the pre-election period to convey her concern about their decisions to stop offering
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
         GCSEs
        </abbr>
        and
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Education Advanced Level">
         A levels
        </abbr>
        in certain languages.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then the government has worked with Ofqual and the exam boards to secure agreement that these important subjects will not be dropped and that qualifications will continue to be provided in these important subjects. Pearson and AQA will continue to offer the languages they currently offer and will also take on most of the qualifications that are being withdrawn by OCR.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of those discussions the following languages will continue at
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        and
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
         A level

        The number of pupils entering for a modern language
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        has risen by 20% since 2010. Today’s announcement will ensure pupils will continue to be able to learn as wide a range of languages as possible in the classroom.
       </p>
       <p>
        Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         One of Britain’s strengths is its rich, multicultural nature and ensuring young people have the opportunity to study a wide range of languages is integral to that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am delighted that these languages will continue at
         <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
          GCSE
         </abbr>
         and
         <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
          A level
         </abbr>
         . Learning a foreign language opens up a whole world of opportunity and ensures our young people will be able to compete on a global scale.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         I also want to thank those exam boards who have worked with us to protect these languages so we will continue to have high quality qualifications available.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Pearson and AQA will now work to develop new
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">

        </abbr>
        that meet the rigorous standards put in place by government, ready for first teaching in 2018. To help with the transition OCR has agreed to continue offering
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">

        and

        in those courses until 2018.
       </p>
       <p>
        Andrew Hall, AQA’s Chief Executive, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         As an education charity, we’ve been working really hard to find a way to continue offering our

         </abbr>
         in Bengali, Modern Hebrew, Panjabi and Polish. As we’ve always said, there were significant barriers - but the
         <abbr title="Department for Education">
          DfE
         </abbr>
         and Ofqual have helped to remove them. So I’m delighted to say that, subject to agreeing appropriate content, we’ll be able not only to continue offering these four languages at both

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         We believe that awarding organisations, government and schools should all work together in the interests of the students who want to have access to these qualifications, which are of great importance to communities across the UK and abroad.

        From 2014 to March 2016 the government provided £1.8 million to train teachers to teach the new languages curriculum in primary and secondary schools. This will help teachers in particular with the more demanding aspects of the new curriculums.

        By introducing the
        <abbr title="English Baccalaureate">
         EBacc
        </abbr>
        , we have stopped the decline in modern foreign languages seen in the last decade, where 200,000 fewer
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        students studied a modern language in 2010 than in 2002. Last year’s results showed 20% more pupils are taking languages at
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE

        than in 2010 while

        entries in modern languages have increased by nearly 5% since 2014
       </p>
       <p>
        It is compulsory for local-authority-maintained schools to teach a modern foreign language to pupils at key stage 3 (ages 11 to 14), and schools are free to choose which language to teach. Maintained primary schools have also been required to teach a modern foreign or ancient language at key stage 2 (ages 7 to 11) since 2014.
