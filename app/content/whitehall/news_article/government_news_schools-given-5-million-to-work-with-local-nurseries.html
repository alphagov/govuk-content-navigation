       <p>
        Young children across the country are set to benefit from the best possible start in life thanks to a brand-new initiative backed by £5 million of government funding to boost the quality of early years education.
       </p>
       <p>
        The funding announced today (29 January 2015) will be awarded to more than 60 teaching schools across the country who will partner up with local nurseries to drive up standards and share best practice. All partners will be able to learn from each other in order to provide better early education and care for children and families, and support effective transitions from nursery into primary school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence shows that the early years count. Children from less advantaged backgrounds can start school 19 months behind their peers, but good-quality early years education can reduce this gap and have a significant benefit in terms of a child’s development.
       </p>
       <p>
        Children who benefit from good-quality early years can go on to earn around £27,000 more during their career compared to those who don’t, and are also likely to do better at school - the equivalent of 7 GCSE grades at grade ‘B’ compared to grade ‘C’.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister for Childcare Sam Gyimah today visited St Pauls Nursery School in Bristol, which will benefit from £60,000 funding to develop programmes with local nurseries to help meet the needs of children in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sam Gyimah, Minister for Childcare, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I was delighted to visit St Pauls Nursery School to learn more about how Bristol’s children are set to benefit from this innovative scheme, which will help ensure they receive the very best early years education.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know the first few years of a child’s life can be make or break in terms of how well they go on to do at school and beyond - and the sharing of expertise and best practice is vital to driving innovation and raising standards.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         This is a fantastic example of local schools, nurseries and private providers pulling together to improve the fantastic services on offer to families, helping their children to thrive.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The new scheme will enable local nurseries to work with the very best early years teachers and school leaders to increase the quality of early years education in their area. The government recognises that systems based on the sharing of expertise are the best way to drive up standards in the sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today’s announcement is just the latest step in the government’s drive to make sure all children - no matter what their starting point in life - receive the best possible start in life and are ready to begin school, especially those from low-income families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 2010, the government has also:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         expanded 15 hours of free early education to 40% of 2-year-olds
        </li>
        <li>
         improved the quality of staff entering the early years workforce by introducing early years teachers
        </li>
        <li>
         reducing regulation to make it easier for new providers to open and existing ones to expand through the Small Business, Employment and Enterprise Bill
        </li>
       </ul>
