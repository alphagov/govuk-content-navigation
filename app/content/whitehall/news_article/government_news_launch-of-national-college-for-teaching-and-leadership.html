      The National College for Teaching and Leadership is a single agency focused on promoting high-quality teaching and school leadership. Its remit will also include continuous professional and leadership development and supporting school improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The main driver behind the merger is to bring together the key building blocks for the creation of the school-led system. The new agency will build on the best from the Teaching Agency and National College and will work in new ways to support the school-led system.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Secretary Michael Gove said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       The creation of the National College for Teaching and Leadership brings together and builds on the excellent work led by the Teaching Agency and the National College. Importantly it will ensure that the best schools are at the heart of teacher training, professional development and school improvement. High-quality teaching and leadership are vital in raising standards in schools.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Charlie Taylor, chief executive of the new agency, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The merger of the National College and Teaching Agency makes perfect sense. This is an exciting opportunity, uniting the strengths of both.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Together we will be better able to support the best schools, the best leaders and the best teachers as they lead the system.
      </p>
     </blockquote>

      Notes to editors:
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Teaching Agency is responsible for the recruitment, supply and initial training and development of teachers. It also supports the recruitment and development of early education and childcare workers, special educational needs coordinators and education psychologists, and oversees the regulation of the conduct of teachers. In addition, the exams delivery support unit supports exams officers and manages general qualifications logistics.
     </p>
     <p>
      The National College for School Leadership works to develop and support great leaders of schools and early years settings so that they can make a positive difference to children’s lives. This includes the development of a national network of Teaching Schools, designating National and Local Leaders of Education and the move to license school-led partnerships to offer leadership development and qualifications, including the National Professional Qualification for Headship.
     </p>
     <p>
      In total, 1,619 responded to the consultation on the new name of the agency. Seventy- four per cent of all survey respondents selected the ‘National College for Teaching and Leadership’ as the preferred name.
