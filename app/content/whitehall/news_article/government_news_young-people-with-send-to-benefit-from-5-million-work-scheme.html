      Young people with special educational needs and disabilities (
      <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">
       SEND
      </abbr>
      ) will be helped to make the difficult transition from school to the professional world thanks to a new £5 million government initiative, announced today (12 March 2015).
     </p>
     <p>
      People with the most severe forms of
      <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">
       SEND
      </abbr>
      can find it difficult to enter the world of work, with an employment rate as low as 7%. However, a government trial of supported internships resulted in 36% of students with
      <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">
       SEND
      </abbr>
      gaining paid employment. Today’s funding will help thousands more young people receive this life-changing support.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local authorities will use the money to create relationships with employers, establish employment services and help schools to offer high-quality preparation for employment.

     <p>
      Children and Families Minister Edward Timpson
      <abbr title="Member of Parliament">
       MP
      </abbr>
      marked the announcement by visiting Mencap offices in central London today to meet people who will benefit from the announcement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Edward Timpson said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       It’s absolutely vital that young people with special educational needs and disabilities are supported through the often difficult transition from school into work.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       The £5 million announced today will mean many more talented young people in supported internships and work placements, helping them make that first step onto the career ladder.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      To mark the announcement, the minister took part in a ‘roundtable’ with 25 people including young adults who have completed supported internships, staff from Mencap and representatives from companies who take on young people with special needs, including KPMG, National Grid and McDonald’s.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mark Capper, Head of Employer Engagement at Mencap, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       People with a learning disability have the lowest employment rate amongst disabled people. Just 7% of people with a learning disability have a paid job, yet around 80% can work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many barriers stop people with a learning disability securing a job, from a lack of work experience opportunities, through to the often negative attitudes of employers and a lack of accessible information.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       We see people with a learning disability succeed in employment with the right support. This includes support not only to find work, but to develop in their role once they are employed. We welcome any initiative that will give people the skills, confidence and opportunities they need to move into the workplace.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      KPMG’s programme to support young adults with
      <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">
       SEND
      </abbr>
      into paid employment has recently resulted in former supported intern Josh Bingham being offered a full-time job at his client hospitality placement with contractor Restaurant Associates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Matt Wood, Director of Operations at Restaurant Associates, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Josh was truly wonderful throughout his internship, and I’m absolutely thrilled to announce that we have now offered him a position within our team. We can’t wait for him to join us in a permanent capacity from next month.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The government’s wider
      <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">
       SEND
      </abbr>
      reforms have extended rights and protection to young people and introduce a new education, health and care plan which reflects the aspirations of young people and the outcomes they want to achieve. It helps them prepare for adult life, including employment and independent living.

      Local authorities can use the £5 million funding to:
