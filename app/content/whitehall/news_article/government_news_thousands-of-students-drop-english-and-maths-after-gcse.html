         New figures
        </a>
        published today expose for the first time the colleges and school sixth forms who have allowed tens of thousands of young people to drop English and maths - even though they had only just missed out on vital C grades in these key subjects at secondary school.
       </p>
       <p>
        The statistics underline why the government has insisted that all post-16 education providers must teach English and maths to young people who failed to achieve C grades in their
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSEs
        </abbr>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department for Education introduced the key reform this term so that thousands more young people have the chance to leave school, college or training with a good grasp of English and maths.
       </p>
       <p>
        From now on, all pupils who fail to have achieved a C grade or better in English or maths
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        by the time they finish secondary school must continue to study the subjects in post-16 education until they get these qualifications.
       </p>
       <p>
        Figures published today show for the first time that colleges and other post-16 education providers have previously allowed a huge number of students to drop the subjects after
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        - including tens of thousands who had only just missed out on getting a C grade.
       </p>
       <p>
        They reveal that:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         almost three-quarters of students who achieved a D in their English
         <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
          GCSE
         </abbr>
         at secondary school (73%, or 71,000 young people) did not enter the exam in post-16 education
        </li>
        <li>
         two-thirds of students who achieved a D grade in their maths
         <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
          GCSE
         </abbr>
         at secondary school (66%, or 54,000 young people) did not enter the exam in post-16 education
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        This is in spite of employers who say that a C grade in these key subjects hugely improves young people’s job prospects.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 2013
        <abbr title="Confederation of British Industry">
         CBI
        </abbr>
        skills survey, just under a third of employers said they were dissatisfied with school and college leavers’ basic literacy and numeracy (32% and 31% respectively). Almost half of firms (48%) said they laid on basic remedial training for employees, up from 42% last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The statistics also follow this week’s international survey of adult skills from the
        <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation">
         OECD
        </abbr>
        which showed the low standard of literacy and numeracy among 16- to 24-year-olds in England compared to their peers in other developed countries.

        Schools Minister David Laws said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         English and maths are what employers demand before all other subjects - if young people want to get on in life, they must be able to show they have good literacy and numeracy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Colleges and sixth forms should be clear with their students that these are essential subjects and must be continued.
        </p>
        <p>
         But these figures expose the vast number of young people allowed to give up these subjects after so nearly achieving the level employers demand.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         With just a bit more teaching, these students could have achieved the grades that would make all the difference to their job prospects.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The post-16 English and maths reform was proposed in 2011 by Professor Alison Wolf in her ground-breaking review of vocational education, and backed by Education Secretary Michael Gove.
       </p>
       <p>
        She also recommended that the Department for Education publish statistics showing the percentage of young people each college or school helps achieve a C or better in English and in maths.
       </p>
       <p>
        She said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Good English and maths grades are fundamental to young people’s employment and education prospects. Individuals with very low literacy and numeracy are severely disadvantaged in the labour market.
        </p>
