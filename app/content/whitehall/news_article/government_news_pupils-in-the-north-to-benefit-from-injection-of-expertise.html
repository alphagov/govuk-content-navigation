        Thousands of children and parents across the north will benefit from a £10 million “injection of expertise” to local schools, Chancellor George Osborne and Education Secretary Nicky Morgan announced today (27 February 2015) during a visit to the North East.
       </p>
       <p>
        The funding will allow the best academies in the north to share their excellence by becoming sponsors of underperforming neighbouring schools. Alongside this, the expertise of some of the very best academy groups from across the country will be used to help improve exam results in areas where pupils are being most let down, transforming the futures of young people in one of the country’s most historically underperforming regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today ministers also announced a new technical school in Newcastle that will see thousands of young people in the area trained as
        <abbr title="information technology">
         IT
        </abbr>
        and healthcare science experts, hailed as a future “landmark institution of the north” by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan.

        , which will open in 2017 and soon educate up to 600 students a year, is sponsored by the University of Sunderland, tech giants Accenture and Hewlett Packard, and local

         NHS
        </abbr>
        hospital trusts will also help to train young people for careers in medical sciences and information technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chancellor George Osborne said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The long-term economic plan for the North East that I’m setting out today is all about boosting the economy and creating jobs. Supporting skills and training is a key part of that, and that starts with ensuring young people in the north of England get the best education possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         That’s why today I’m approving a new university technical college in Newcastle, specialising in health science, with space for up to 600 students. Sponsored by the University of Sunderland and Accenture, and in partnership with the local
         <abbr title="National Health Service">
          NHS
         </abbr>
         trusts, this brilliant project will give another boost to the north-east economy, by encouraging scientific excellence - a core part of our plan to build a northern powerhouse.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         We are already delivering real results for young people here: since 2010 nearly a quarter of a million more pupils in the north of England are attending ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ schools. And we’re going further today, by setting out our plans for how we will use £10 million extra support to further improve educational standards across Teesside.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Our plan for education has resulted in 1 million more pupils in ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ schools than in 2010 - with every region in the country improving in this measure.
        </p>
        <p>
         But for too long pupils in some parts of the country including the north have been let down by underperforming schools, with generations of pupils seeing their potential left unfulfilled through no fault of their own.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our £10 million injection of expertise to northern schools will allow the best academy sponsors in the region to share their knowledge and expertise, while harnessing the excellence of the nation’s top teachers to boost exam results - underlining our commitment to helping all pupils succeed.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Parents and students will benefit greatly from the new

         professionals and healthcare scientists, giving them the knowledge, skills and qualifications needed to fulfil their potential.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The government’s plan for education has delivered results, with 1 million more pupils now in ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ schools than in 2010. In the north alone, 242,000 more pupils are now in top schools than in 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the new funding comes as recently published
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        results highlighted the extent to which further action is needed to tackle school underperformance in the north:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and Humber regions respectively the rate of children achieving 5 or more good
         <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
          GCSEs
         </abbr>
         , including English and maths, is 55.8%, 54.6% and 53.9% compared to 56.8% nationally
        </li>
        <li>
         Yorkshire and Humber has the lowest educational achievement of any region in the country, both at the end of primary school and

          GCSE
         </abbr>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The 3 regional schools commissioners covering the north of England will use their expertise as education sector leaders to use the funding to:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         bring some of the best academy sponsors from across the country, and from other parts of the region, to set up new clusters of academies where they are needed most
        </li>
        <li>
         develop and build the capacity of existing sponsors to keep pace with new demands
        </li>
        <li>
         enable more strong academy converters in the region to become sponsors of other schools
        </li>
