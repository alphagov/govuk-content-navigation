       National Apprenticeship Week
      </a>
      theme is “An apprenticeship can take you anywhere”, with a particular focus on higher skills to show how young people, entrepreneurs and businesses can “rise to the top” through traineeships and apprenticeships.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both employers and their apprentices have a great opportunity to step into the spotlight during National Apprenticeship Week, to help us show how, with an apprenticeship, you can rise to the top.
     </p>
     <p>
      National Apprenticeship Week is co-ordinated by the National Apprenticeship Service and is designed to celebrate apprenticeships and the positive impact they have on individuals, businesses and the wider economy.
