        The inspection of Kingston upon Hull council was conducted by Her Majesty’s Inspectors between 7 and 11 December 2015. Three schools were inspected as part of this exercise and a telephone survey of a sample of 13 schools and academies was carried out between 1 and 5 December 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, inspectors held discussions with elected members, the Chief Executive, senior officers and staff, headteachers and governors from maintained schools and academies, officers and partners representing the early years and post-16 education provision, senior staff from local authority traded services, national and local leaders of education and partners delivering services brokered or commissioned by the local authority.
       </p>
       <p>
        The inspection team also reviewed a range of documents, including the recently developed ambitions strategy and school improvement strategy, data about school and academy performance across the city and reports to members on the performance of schools.

          The framework for the inspection of local authority arrangements for supporting school improvement
         </a>
         . The aim of local authority school improvement inspection is to assist local authorities in their duty to promote high standards and fulfilment of potential so that all children and young people benefit from at least a good education.  The inspection framework acts as a powerful lever for improvement by helping to challenge inconsistencies. It enables Ofsted to report more rigorously on the contribution of local authorities to improving education in England. The inspection is not universal. Ofsted will normally inspect only where concerns about performance are apparent or where requested to do so by the Secretary of State.
