      Top computing firms including Microsoft, Google and IBM are joining forces with the government to train more than 45,000 teachers ahead of the introduction of the rigorous new computing curriculum in September - equivalent to around 2 teachers for every school in England.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the latest scheme to complement more than £3 million worth of support from the Department for Education (
      <abbr title="the Department for Education">
       DfE
      </abbr>
      ) to schools. So far nearly 7,000 teachers have already received training from the network of 400 ‘master teachers’ established by the British Computer Society (
      <abbr title="British Computer Society">
       BCS
      </abbr>
      ), while Computing at School (
      <abbr title="Computing at School">
       CAS
      </abbr>
      ) is running workshops to help train primary teachers. There are currently more than 15,000
      <abbr title="information technology">
       IT
      </abbr>
      teachers in secondary schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      This latest project sees
      <abbr title="the Department for Education">
       DfE
      </abbr>
      and leading tech firms, alongside organisations including the
      <abbr title="British Computer Society">
       BCS
      </abbr>
      , University of Hertfordshire, Code Club and Oxford University, funding 7 new training projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      These initiatives will provide a mix of national conferences, 1-day events, individual training sessions, and resources including 2 computing curriculum guidance books for every secondary school in England.
     </p>
     <p>
      The projects are the result of a £500,000 match fund launched by
      <abbr title="the Department for Education">
       DfE
      </abbr>
      in February. Industry groups and computing organisations were invited to submit proposals for training projects that would be match-funded by the government.
     </p>
     <p>
      Microsoft provided £284,000 for a joint project with the
      <abbr title="British Computer Society">
       BCS
      </abbr>
      and
      <abbr title="Computing at School">
       CAS
      </abbr>
      to expand a network of computing hubs and schools to provide training for 30,000 primary teachers and 12,000 secondary teachers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another project is backed by £52,500 from Oxford University’s philosophy and computer science faculties, the university’s Van Houten Fund and a private philanthropist. This scheme will provide resources and offer training to secondary school teachers in how to use 2 popular software systems, developed at Oxford, that will help them run coding and computer science lessons for students.
     </p>
     <p>
      The match fund programme is the latest initiative by the government working with the computer industry to ensure teachers at primary and secondary level have the right support and are equipped with the skills they need to teach the new curriculum.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Our new computing curriculum will excite children about the endless potential of technology and give them the skills they need to make that technology work for them. That’s vital in the 21st century and could help them go on to create the next big app.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       But great teachers are a key part of this and that’s why we are continuing to work with the industry and computer experts to invest in our teachers and make sure they are ready to open up this exciting world to our children.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The new, more demanding computing curriculum was drawn up in conjunction with teachers and experts including the
      <abbr title="British Computer Society">
       BCS
      </abbr>
      and the Royal Academy of Engineering, with input from Microsoft, Google and leaders in the computer games industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      The new forward-thinking curriculum, which is already being taught in some schools, will teach children the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century and make computers work for them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Starting in primary school, children will be taught how to code, create programmes and understand how a computer works. In secondary school, they will learn even more complex skills such as how to use at least 2 programming languages to solve computational problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      Michel Van der Bel, Managing Director of Microsoft UK, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Young people have grown up with technology at their fingertips and they have a natural enthusiasm for it. But if we want the next technology success story to be based in Britain, then we need teachers who have the right skills and the confidence to encourage, support and enable them to do so.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Industry support is vital to help bring the curriculum to life, which is why Microsoft has partnered with the Computing At School group to deliver a series of personal training sessions and to develop a suite of online training materials as teachers get ready for those first lessons.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Mike Warriner, UK Engineering Director at Google, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The UK has a proud computing history, but with more and more industries wanting computer scientists, coding has never been in more demand. It’s great that teachers will be trained with the skills they need to teach children from a young age and hopefully inspire the next generation of developers and programmers.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       We’re passionate about this area too and we have already donated £120,000 to Code Club as well as around £1,000,000 over the last year to support other organisations like Teach First and the Raspberry Pi Foundation to help education experts bring computer science skills to more children in the UK.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The first 7 projects range from major national projects helping thousands of teachers around the country to programmes which will provide bespoke, personalised training to teachers across London.
