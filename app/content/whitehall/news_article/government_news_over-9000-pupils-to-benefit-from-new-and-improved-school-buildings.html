       <blockquote>

         We are delighted to confirm the first two contractors who will work with us on our £2.4 billion Priority School Building programme. This programme will provide new or refurbished school buildings for the children being educated in those schools that are in the very worst condition.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Boyd McFee, Director from Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Sir Robert McAlpine is delighted to have been appointed to deliver the first batch of schools in the north-east, Yorkshire and Humberside under the Priority School Building programme.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         We have been working with a strong team of designers and supply chain partners for more than a year to develop our approach in readiness for the PSBP and look forward to partnering with the Education Funding Agency in the delivery of these important schools.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Steve Beechey, Group Investment Director and Head of Education for Wates, commented:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Today’s announcement is fantastic news for Wates, as this a great opportunity for us to demonstrate our expertise in the construction of next generation school buildings. We look forward to acting as a contractor for the development of these school buildings and delivering cost effective school solutions for the nation’s schoolchildren.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The selected contractors will now work with the Education Funding Agency (EFA) and the schools to develop detailed designs and submit planning proposals for each scheme before building work begins in the spring.
       </p>
       <p>
        Good progress is being made on the remaining 6 capital funded batches. The contractors on the EFA Contractors’ Framework will be invited to tender for these batches in January and February. The 261 schools to be rebuilt or renovated under the Priority Schools Building programme were announced in May 2012 and are available on the Department’s website.

         <p>
          Since 2010 this government has allocated £2.7 billion to local authorities to support the provision of new school places and £2.8 billion for the maintenance of the school estate to meet the needs of maintained schools and academies. Over the spending review period, the total capital made available for investment in schools in England will be about £18 billion.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          In order to ascertain the renovation needs of the schools estate in England, the Department for Education has been conducting a national programme of surveys, which should be available by autumn 2013. Information on the condition of all schools was last collated centrally in 2005.
