      Fewer pupils are persistently missing school than ever before - and the number of pupils in this category has almost halved since 2010,
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/pupil-absence-in-schools-in-england-2013-to-2014">
       new figures published today (26 March 2015) reveal
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The fall in young people missing classes has come after teachers were given new powers to tackle absenteeism, as part of the government’s plan for education.
     </p>
     <p>
      Figures show the number of pupils regularly missing school in 2013 to 2014, classed as persistent absentees, is down nearly 200,000 over the last 5 years - the lowest level since comparable records began.
     </p>
     <p>
      The number of persistent absentees has dropped every year since 2009 to 2010 - and has fallen by 46%, from 433,130, over the period.
     </p>
     <p>
      The statistics released today follow recent research that shows even short gaps in a child’s school attendance can reduce their chances of achieving good qualifications by as much as a quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today’s figures also reveal:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the number of school days missed due to absence has fallen by a quarter since 2009 to 2010 when 57.0 million days were lost
      </li>
      <li>
       the number of days missed due to family holidays fell by 1.4 million last year - and has dropped by 2.3 million days since 2009 to 2010
      </li>
      <li>
       pupils missed an average of 7.9 days over the full 2013 to 2014 academic year - down from 9.3 days the year before
      </li>
      <li>
       every single local authority saw a fall in their overall absence rates since the previous year
      </li>
      <li>
       Blackpool saw the biggest drop in the rate of persistent absence - with a 42% year-on-year fall. 4.3% of pupils regularly miss school in the area
      </li>
      <li>
       Newham had one of the lowest absence rates in the country despite high levels of deprivation, with an overall absence rate of 4%. The persistent absence rate also stands at just 2.6%
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A pupil is classified as ‘persistently absent’ if they miss around 15% of school  - which equates to around 18 months of lesson time over their whole school career.
     </p>
     <p>
      School Reform Minister Nick Gibb said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       We know that missing school can be hugely detrimental to a pupil’s life chances - but we now have around 200,000 fewer young people regularly missing lessons than 5 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single lost day counts - which is why as part of our plan for education we have put teachers back in charge so they can clamp down on classroom absence.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Fewer school days are being lost than ever before thanks to our reforms - giving children the best possible chance to succeed.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Research published last month showed just how important school attendance is.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nearly half of pupils - 44% - with no absence at key stage 4 achieve the English Baccalaureate, which includes English, maths, science, history or geography and a language.
     </p>
     <p>
      But just 31.7% of pupils who miss 14 days of classes over their 2-year GCSE courses achieve the same level - and that fell to 16.4% for those who miss up to 28 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      The government has made a range of reforms to encourage good attendance from their pupils. Measures introduced since 2010 include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       encouraging schools to tackle the problem of persistent absence earlier. The government reduced the threshold by which absence is defined as persistent from 20% to 15% from October 2011. This means schools are held to a higher standard in performance tables than before
      </li>
      <li>
       from September 2015, the persistent absence threshold will be reduced further from 15% to 10%
      </li>
      <li>
       making it clear that headteachers should authorise a leave of absence only in exceptional circumstances rather than as a matter of routine
      </li>
      <li>
       making clear that teachers can use ‘reasonable force’ to maintain behaviour and extending their searching powers from 2011
      </li>
      <li>
       allowing teachers to impose same-day detentions from 2011
      </li>
     </ul>
