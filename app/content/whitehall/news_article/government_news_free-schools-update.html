      Of the 323 proposals received, 41 were approved to move to business case and plan stage or beyond, although one proposal was subsequently withdrawn by the proposer.
     </p>
     <p>
      30 of the remaining 40 proposals, including a number that aim to open in September 2012 or beyond, have now been approved to move to the pre-opening stage.
     </p>
     <p>
      The groups behind nine of these proposals have entered into a funding agreement with the Secretary of State. Further applications which have moved to pre-opening stage or have signed a funding agreement will be listed in due course.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eight proposals that were in business case and plan stage, for schools opening in September 2012 or beyond, were invited to apply through the new application process. This closed in June.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the second round of applications to open Free Schools from 2012, there were 281 applications from groups who want to set up schools, and 37 applications for new University Technical Colleges. Successful applications will be announced in September.
     </p>
     <p>
