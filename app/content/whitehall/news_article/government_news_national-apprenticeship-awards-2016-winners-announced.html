      <p>
       We took on apprentices because it was the right thing to do; for social mobility, improved staff retention and for the future of our business. But what’s amazed us most is how well the apprentices have performed, they still surprise us every day.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Recruiting apprentices as paralegals allows us to attract smart, enthusiastic and engaged people into law – people that never previously would have thought a career in law was for them, or even possible. We’re committed to continuing our apprenticeship scheme and building on it in the years ahead.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Skills and Apprenticeships Minister Robert Halfon said:
     </p>

      <p>
       Apprenticeships work. They give people of all ages and all backgrounds the ladder of opportunity to get paid experience in work and a top class qualification at the same time.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       The National Apprenticeship Awards ensure apprenticeships get the prestige they deserve, while shining a light on the fantastic work that both apprentices and their employers do. Congratulations to all the winners - they are champions showcasing how apprenticeships to give everyone the chance to get on.

      Ulf Bengtsson, Group Head of Learning and Development, Centrica said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       I am thrilled for all of the organisations recognised this evening as part of the Top 100 Apprenticeship Employers in 2016. Helping develop skills and capabilities in communities is incredibly important to building the reputation of UK industry. At Centrica we are immensely proud of the role our apprenticeship schemes have played in developing a capability that sets many industry benchmarks, and are excited to be in the company of so many organisations who are committed to the same cause.
      </p>

      Sue Husband, director, National Apprenticeship Service, concluded:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The National Apprenticeship Awards have highlighted once again the magnificent range of apprenticeships on offer - with leading employers in exciting industries - and the skills that apprentices gain when taking on these roles.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Every year this event gets bigger and better, bringing to the forefront of our minds the importance of apprenticeships to local, regional and national economies. Apprenticeships are for everyone and I personally thank each and every employer and apprentice here tonight, for their commitment to apprenticeships.
