        The secondary school
        <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance/index.html" rel="external">
         performance tables
        </a>
        show that standards are rising in sponsored academies at a record rate - and more than 5 times as quickly than in all state-funded schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        Across all state-funded schools, the proportion of pupils who achieved at least 5 good GCSEs (including in English and maths) rose by 0.6 percentage points. In sponsored academies, the increase was 3.1 percentage points.
       </p>
       <p>
        The change in the number of schools below the floor also illustrates how many heads and teachers - in all state-funded schools - are responding to the new firm but fair floor standards introduced by the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        A school is below the floor if 40% of its pupils do not achieve at least five GCSEs at C or better including English and maths, and if pupils’ progress is not good enough in both those two subjects. Last year the floor standard was 35% in attainment, alongside the progress measures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall 195 secondary schools are below the floor this year, 56 fewer than last year had the floor been the same (40%).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statistics also demonstrate how sponsored academies increasingly turn to academic subjects once they have got pupils secure in the basics of English and maths.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was a 6 percentage point increase (to 88%) in the proportion of sponsored academies offering the EBacc - the combination of core academic subjects most valued by universities and employers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Across all state-funded schools, 16% of pupils achieved the EBacc, up almost one percentage point.
       </p>
       <p>
        A DfE spokesman said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         These figures are further evidence of the great success of the Academies programme in turning around our weakest schools - sponsored academies are improving their GCSE results 5 times faster than other schools.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         They reveal the amazing power of academy sponsors to turn around under-performing schools - often schools which have been persistently sub-standard.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         This shows we are right to continue to support the sponsored Academies programme. These brilliant sponsors have a track record of arresting decline - and then reversing it.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
