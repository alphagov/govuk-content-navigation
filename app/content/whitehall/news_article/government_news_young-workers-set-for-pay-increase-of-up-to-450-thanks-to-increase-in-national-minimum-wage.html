       <ul>
        <li>
         almost 270,000 of the UK’s lowest paid workers to benefit from £450 annual pay rise
        </li>
        <li>
         the new £6.95 National Minimum Wage is the highest rate ever in real terms
        </li>
        <li>
         workers are reminded to check their pay slips are updated to reflect new rates
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Young workers earning the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">
         National Minimum Wage
        </a>
        are set to receive a pay rise of up to £450 a year from today (1 October 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Around 270,000 workers aged 21 to 24 years earning the minimum wage will see their hourly wage rise by 25p an hour to £6.95. It is the largest increase since 2008, outstripping average wage growth and inflation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new rate is the highest ever National Minimum Wage in real terms, surpassing the previous pre-recession peak. Those working 35 hours a week will get a boost of £450 a year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Around 210,000 workers aged under-21 years and
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apprenticeships-guide/pay-and-conditions">
         apprentices
        </a>
        will also see an increase to their earnings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Business Secretary Greg Clark said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The government promised to create an economy that works for all and today’s increase means our lowest paid workers will benefit from their largest pay rise since the recession.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         This will make a real difference to hard-working people up and down the country and means for the vast majority of workers, the National Minimum Wage is at its highest level in real terms.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Everyone entitled to the national minimum or living wage has to receive it. Employers who fail to pay are found and punished, as well as being publicly named and shamed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has increased
        <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">
         HMRC
        </abbr>
        ’s enforcement budget this year by £7 million, improving its ability to crack down on employers who fail to pay staff properly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rise in the National Minimum Wage follows the introduction of the £7.20 National Living Wage in April 2016 for those aged 25 years and over, giving around 1.3 million workers a pay rise.
