       best practice guidance
      </a>
      is aimed at helping local authorities, governing bodies, headteachers and school staff (in maintained schools and academies) make decisions on school uniforms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister David Laws said that, in particular, the new guidance placed greater emphasis on how schools should try to secure value for money for parents around school uniforms.
     </p>
     <p>
      It suggests that schools should:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       avoid exclusive single-supplier contracts except when regular tendering competitions are run, in which more than 1 supplier can compete for the contract, and where best value can be secured
      </li>
      <li>
       not enter into ‘cash back’ arrangements
      </li>
      <li>
       not insist that pupils wear expensive items of uniform
      </li>
      <li>
       not make frequent changes to uniform specifications
      </li>
      <li>
       seek to select items that can be purchased cheaply, for example, in a supermarket or other good value shop
      </li>
      <li>
       keep compulsory branded items to a minimum
      </li>
     </ul>
