     <p>
      An online app that lets children report bullying using screenshots of social media will be rolled out to hundreds of schools thanks to a £4.4 million government fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      ‘Tootoot’ is an online platform providing 24-hour support to young people who are victims of bullying or online abuse.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cyber bullying gives bullies the cover of anonymity but the app counteracts this by allowing children to report bullying incidents anonymously themselves.
     </p>
     <p>
      They can screenshot abusive messages or even take photographs of bullies in action, then send them via the app. The reports will then be read by staff at the child’s school, but no one else.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today the Department for Education announced that tootoot and 9 other innovative schemes to tackle bullying in schools are being backed with £4.4million of government investment.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a result, 120,000 students across 300 schools will be able to use the programme to report incidents such as bullying, cyber bullying, or homophobic, transphobic and biphobic abuse. The scheme, run by Internet Matters, will also train 4,500 teachers and educate 60,000 parents about how to protect their children from cyberbullying. 
An online hub will provide thousands of children, parents and carers with support around the clock, including in school holidays, with advice on tackling bullying and tips on how to block and report abuse on a range of online platforms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Secretary Justine Greening said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       School should be a safe place where children can go to grow and learn. No child should ever be bullied and apps like this now mean support for any child is only a click away.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Carolyn Bunting, General Manager of Internet Matters, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       We’re delighted to be working with tootoot - an organisation giving students a safe environment to report bullying through its innovative app. We’re pleased that the Department for Education is helping us and tootoot roll this programme out to as many schools as possible.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Intimidation and victimisation used to be limited to the playground, but now extends beyond the school gates. Reporting tools like tootoot allow children to raise issues like bullying confidentially.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
