      One of the founders of Games Workshop, who helped revamp the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study">
       computing curriculum
      </a>
      , is to open 2 new free schools specialising in computer science, technology and the arts, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan announced today (5 February 2016) as she revealed the latest batch of this Parliament’s 500 new schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      Drawing on his experience as a videogame entrepreneur, Ian Livingstone will open the Livingstone Academies in Tower Hamlets and Bournemouth, which will provide over 3,000 children with a rigorous education rooted in
      <abbr title="science, technology, engineering, arts and maths">
       STEAM
      </abbr>
      - science, technology, engineering, arts and maths. The schools, to be opened under the Aspirations Academy Trust, will use the founder’s extensive links to the creative industries to instil creative thinking and enterprise in their pupils, who will sit ‘Dragon’s Den’ style competitions and start up mock companies at the schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2010 Ian Livingstone was invited to review digital skills in England and concluded that
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-focus-is-needed-on-ict-and-computer-science-skills-development-says-government">
       poor-quality
       <abbr title="information technology">
        IT
       </abbr>
       teaching in schools is an obstacle to growth
      </a>
      . The review was influential in leading to an
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/harmful-ict-curriculum-set-to-be-dropped-to-make-way-for-rigorous-computer-science">
       overhauling of
       <abbr title="information technology">
        IT
       </abbr>
       teaching and the introduction of a new computer science curriculum
      </a>
      . The 2 schools announced today will build on this by being exemplary institutions of computing and creative thinking.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today, the Education Secretary is also announcing plans to form a new body of experienced property specialists to help find sites for future free schools. An advisory group is being set up to inform development of the new body, and this will include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Michael Strong, former Executive Chairman of CBRE Europe, Middle East and Africa
      </li>
      <li>
       Philip Bell-Brown, Group Property Director at Dixons Carphone
      </li>
      <li>
       Ric Lewis, Chief Executive of Tristan Capital Partners
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Finding sites quickly is often the biggest obstacle to opening new schools, so we need to ensure we have the right people working for us to secure best value for the taxpayer.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2 schools to be opened by Ian Livingstone join 20 others announced today - which will in total create more than 18,000 places for parents across the country.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Free schools are offering a rigorous education in communities which have never before had the opportunity of a good local school. Parents are flocking to them in their droves - and today’s announcement means that over 18,000 more children can benefit from a place in a free school.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       With leading entrepreneur Ian Livingstone stepping up to open 2 schools, the free schools programme is proving to be a vital outlet for our society’s most creative and innovative people to spread their excellence to future generations.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Ian Livingstone CBE, Founder and Chairman of the Livingstone Foundation, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The arts and sciences should no longer be a question of either/or - and to further this I’m delighted to be opening 2 free schools to embed digital creativity in future generations of our society.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       It is the combination of computer programming skills and creativity by which today’s world-changing companies are built. I encourage other digital entrepreneurs to seize the opportunity offered by the free schools programme in helping to give children an authentic education for the jobs and opportunities of the digital world.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Also announced today is Shireland High Tech Primary in Smethwick, Birmingham - a free school that will introduce an innovative method of schooling. Instead of the traditional model of lessons followed by homework, pupils will be expected to do the reverse in order to deepen their learning through facilitated discussions and project work in lessons.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today 22 new schools have been approved to open - providing more than 18,000 places for parents across the country. This includes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       1 school in the East of England, creating 1,200 places
      </li>
      <li>
       1 school in the East Midlands, creating 500 places

     </h2>
     <p>
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/set-up-free-school">
       Free schools
      </a>
      are brand-new schools which can be set up by parents, teachers, charities, businesses, cultural and sporting bodies, community groups, academy trusts and sponsors, and existing schools in response to demand from the local community, either where there is a shortage of places, or where the parents are not happy with the places on offer.
     </p>
     <p>
      The new schools announced today, on top of over 380 already opened, will meet the growing demand of parents for more excellent local schools with high standards and strong discipline.
     </p>
     <p>
      74% of open mainstream free schools are located in areas where there was a need for more school places and around half are in the 30% most deprived communities in the country. They are also more likely to be rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted than other state schools - and research has shown they are helping to raise standards in neighbouring schools by introducing fresh ideas and competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/category/item/a-rising-tide-the-competitive-benefits-of-free-schools" rel="external">
       Policy Exchange research
      </a>
      shows that as well as providing an excellent education to their own pupils, they are also associated with improvements in local poorly performing schools. And more than two-thirds of free school heads say they are having a positive impact on schools in their local area - driving up standards and ensuring more parents have a great school in their neighbourhood.
     </p>
     <p>
      We are committed to creating at least 500 new schools by 2020, creating 270,000 school places. There will be 2 free school application rounds every year up to 2020 (with deadlines in March and September). The latest application window to set up a free school opened on 27 January and runs until midday on 2 March 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      We are encouraging businesses, charities, cultural and sporting bodies, community groups and parents to submit applications for new schools. We have revised the application process for those with a proven track record, to encourage more applications from ‘good’ and ‘outstanding’ schools, and high-performing trusts and sponsors.

      Dixons Academy Trust is approved to open Dixons Trinity Leeds for 1,140 primary and secondary aged pupils in the Harehills area of Leeds. Dixons Trinity Leeds will replicate Dixons Trinity Academy in Bradford, which was the first secondary free school to be judged ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted. The school will address the growing need for new secondary school places in the Harehills area, offer access to high-quality education and inspire all pupils to ‘climb the mountain’ to university or a fulfilling career.
