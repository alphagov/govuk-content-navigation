      The government has today published the findings from the review of the Vetting and Barring Scheme.
     </p>
     <p>
      Children’s Minister Tim Loughton said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Protecting children and keeping them safe remains our top priority, but it’s also important that well-meaning adults are not put off working or volunteering with children.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new system will be less bureaucratic and less intimidating. It will empower organisations to ask the right questions and make all the appropriate pre-employment checks, and encourage everyone to be vigilant.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       This is a commonsense and proportionate approach which will ensure that children are properly protected without driving a wedge between them and adults.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
