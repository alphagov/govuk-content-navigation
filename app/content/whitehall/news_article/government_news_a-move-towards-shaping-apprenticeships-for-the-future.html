       The reform of apprenticeships takes another step, as we start to remove some frameworks in the move towards employer-developed standards.

        In 2014 to 2015 there were more than 250,000 employer workplaces employing an apprentice, covering an extensive range of skills levels and occupations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, more than 1,300 employers are involved in industry- led trailblazers groups, between them developing over 150 new employer-led
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/apprenticeship-standards">
         apprenticeship standards
        </a>
        , which will eventually replace the current apprenticeship frameworks as confirmed in
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-in-england-vision-for-2020">
         English Apprenticeships: Our 2020 Vision
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The first batch of frameworks, which will no longer be available to new starts from 1 June, include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Blacksmithing, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies - Level 3
        </li>
        <li>
         Building Products Industry Occupations, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies - Level 2
        </li>
        <li>
         Cabin Crew, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies - Level 2
        </li>
        <li>
         Campaigning, Business Administration and Law - Level 3
        </li>
        <li>
         Energy Assessment and Advice, Retail and Commercial Enterprise - Level 3
        </li>
        <li>
         Providing Mortgage Advice, Business Administration and Law – Level 3
        </li>
        <li>
         Witness Care, Health, Public Services and Care – Level 3
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        There have been no starts in the 2014 to 2015 funding year or up to the half way point of the 2015 to 2016 funding year .
       </p>
       <p>
        We have written to the Issuing Authorities responsible for these frameworks, to give them three months’ notice.   This removal means that no new starts on these frameworks will be allowed from 01 June 2016. We have also consulted with stakeholders including AELP and AoC.
       </p>
       <p>
        Apprentices still completing their apprenticeship on these frameworks will continue to do so, on their agreed funding arrangements, and their apprenticeship completion certificate can be claimed in the same way.
