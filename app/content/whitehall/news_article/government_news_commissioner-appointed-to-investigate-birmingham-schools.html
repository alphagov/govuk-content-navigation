        The Department for Education today, 15 April, appointed Peter Clarke to review evidence in relation to serious allegations that schools in Birmingham are being targeted by individuals wishing to push an Islamist agenda.
       </p>
       <p>
        In his role as Education Commissioner, Peter Clarke will be accountable to the Secretary of State for Education. He will investigate the allegations to understand fully what has happened in the schools of concern, and work closely with Birmingham City Council to analyse evidence of extremist infiltration in both academies and council-run schools. He will report back to the department this summer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Clarke’s appointment means allegations which have been the subject of intense speculation can be examined in a professional and dispassionate manner, based on established facts. He has substantial and much-respected experience in leading investigations at a high level.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I am extremely concerned by the allegations made in connection to a number of schools in Birmingham.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have already asked Ofsted to inspect a number of schools of concern and these investigations are ongoing. But wider, more comprehensive action is needed. These allegations need either to be substantiated and firm action taken, or to be shown to be baseless. We cannot allow uncertainty for parents or pupils to persist.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is why I am appointing a commissioner to oversee this work. Peter Clarke brings a wealth of relevant skills and experience, and is very well placed to lead a fair and thorough assessment of the evidence, and report back to me. We expect he will work closely with Birmingham City Council.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         No pupils should be exposed to extremist views or radicalisation while at school. I have tasked Peter Clarke with getting to the bottom of these allegations, so schools in Birmingham can continue the excellent progress that so many have been making.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The Department for Education has maintained close contact with a number of parties since the allegations were first received, including the police and Birmingham City Council.
       </p>
       <p>
        All schools are subject to a tough inspection regime and the government has been clear that it will not hesitate to take firm and swift action if pupils are being let down or placed at risk.

         <p>
          The Commissioner’s remit will cover both maintained schools and academies (including free schools, university technical colleges and studio schools). He will be supported by a small team of Department for Education officials, and will be able to seek expert opinion and advice as necessary, including from Ofsted. He is likely to be in place initially for 3 to 4 months before reporting back to the Secretary of State for Education.

          This appointment, which is made under statutory powers, is separate to the Department for Education’s intervention in Birmingham’s children’s services. The department has already indicated its intention to appoint a statutory commissioner to oversee these services, which successive Ofsted inspections have found to be inadequate.

          <abbr title="Metropolitan Police Service">

          in 2006 for his work on the 7/7 bombings the previous year. He is currently a board member at the Charity Commission.
