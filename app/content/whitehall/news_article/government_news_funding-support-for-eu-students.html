      The government has today (11 October 2016) announced that
      <abbr title="European Union">
       EU
      </abbr>
      students applying for a place at an English university or further education institution in the 2017 to 2018 academic year will continue to be eligible for student loans and grants - and will be for the duration of their course.
     </p>
     <p>
      The decision will mean that students applying to study from 2017 to 2018 will not only be eligible for the same funding and support as they are now, but that their eligibility will continue throughout their course, even if the
      <abbr title="United Kingdom">
       UK
      </abbr>
      exits the European Union during that period.
     </p>
     <p>
      The move will help give universities and colleges certainty over future funding, while assuring prospective students applying to study at one of the
      <abbr title="United Kingdom">
       UK
      </abbr>
      ’s world leading universities that they will not have the terms of their funding changed if the
      <abbr title="United Kingdom">
       UK
      </abbr>
      leaves the
      <abbr title="European Union">
       EU
      </abbr>
      during their studies. The same assurance will be available for
      <abbr title="European Union">
       EU
      </abbr>
      students studying in further education.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today’s announcement follows assurances given by the government in June shortly after the
      <abbr title="European Union">
       EU
      </abbr>
      referendum result. This included immediate guarantees that students currently in higher or further education, and those applying for a place this year (2016 to 2017) would continue to be able to access student funding support - including loans and grants - under the current eligibility criteria.
     </p>
     <p>
      Universities Minister Jo Johnson said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       We know that the result of the referendum brought with it some uncertainties for our higher education sector. That is why in June we acted quickly to provide immediate funding guarantees for existing students and those applying to study this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       International students make an important contribution to our world-class universities, and we want that to continue. This latest assurance that students applying to study next year will not only be eligible to apply for student funding under current terms, but will have their eligibility maintained throughout the duration of their course, will provide important stability for both universities and students.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       We are also taking steps, through our
       <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/highereducationandresearch.html" rel="external">
        Higher Education Bill
       </a>
       , to maintain the world status of our universities while delivering students value for money and choice and employers the skills they need to help our economy grow.

      Under current student finance rules,
      <abbr title="European Union">
       EU
      </abbr>
      students are eligible to receive undergraduate tuition fee loans and Master’s loans if they have resided in the European Economic Area for at least 3 years prior to study.
      <abbr title="European Union">
       EU
      </abbr>
      nationals who have resided in the
      <abbr title="United Kingdom">
       UK

      for over 5 years are also able to apply for undergraduate maintenance support. Similarly, under
      <abbr title="European Union">
       EU
      </abbr>
      law,
      <abbr title="European Union">
       EU
      </abbr>
      students are also eligible for home fee status, which means they are charged the same tuition fees as
      <abbr title="United Kingdom">
       UK
      </abbr>
      students. Other non-
      <abbr title="European Union">
       EU
      </abbr>
      , international students do not have their tuition fees capped in this way.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today’s confirmation will mean that for
      <abbr title="European Union">
       EU
      </abbr>
      nationals, or their family members, who are applying for a place at university from August 2017 to study a course that attracts student support, the current funding rules will remain unchanged. All applicants will be eligible for student loans and/or grants under the current terms and, if deemed eligible, will be able to receive those for the duration of their course.
