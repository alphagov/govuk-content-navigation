        The Department for Education has announced the names of the 32 headteachers who have been voted by their peers to sit on the boards of the 8 new regional schools commissioners (
        <abbr title="regional school commissioners">
         RSCs
        </abbr>
        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 1,600 headteachers took part in the vote to elect their peers to the headteacher boards (
        <abbr title="headteacher boards">
         HTBs
        </abbr>
        ), which start in September. These new bodies, of 6 to 8 members, will help the 8 newly appointed
        <abbr title="regional school commissioners">
         RSCs
        </abbr>
        be champions for academy freedoms, identify where new academies can be created, and provide a failure regime for the small number of academies which are struggling.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 32 elected are education experts with the experience and local knowledge needed to help academies in their areas flourish. They are all headteachers, or recent headteachers, from schools judged by Ofsted to have ‘outstanding’ leadership and management.

       <p>
        <abbr title="regional school commissioners">
         RSCs
        </abbr>
        will take on responsibilities previously held by the Secretary of State, such as agreeing or rejecting academy applications, and their combined local insight will mean they can make informed decisions on when and how to intervene.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister Lord Nash said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Headteacher boards will provide an excellent body of support for our regional school commissioners in their task of improving the education of pupils across England.
        </p>
        <p>
         These elections show heads recognise the value that
         <abbr title="headteacher boards">
          HTBs
         </abbr>
         can play in shaping the future of the education system.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         The collective expertise and wisdom of
         <abbr title="headteacher boards">
          HTBs
         </abbr>
         will help keep schools to account, champion academy freedoms and ensure swift action is taken when things go wrong.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The number of academy schools has increased dramatically since May 2010, when there were just 203 academies, all sponsored and all secondary. Latest figures show there are now 4,199 academies overall, with 58% of secondary schools now academies and 12% of primaries now academies.

       <p>
        <abbr title="regional school commissioners">
         RSCs
        </abbr>
        ’ responsibilities will include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         taking decisions on the creation of new academies on behalf of the Education Secretary
        </li>
        <li>
         monitoring academy performance and improving underperforming academies
        </li>
        <li>
         ensuring there is a strong supply of excellent sponsors to work with underperforming schools in the region
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Two additional board members will be appointed by each RSC, and the board will be able to co-opt further members to fill skills or expertise gaps.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Commissioner Frank Green said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I am absolutely delighted that we have had so many headteachers taking part in the establishment of the headteacher boards. 159 candidates stood for election for the 32 elected posts on the 8 regional
         <abbr title="headteacher boards">
          HTBs
         </abbr>
         with a turnout of almost 40% in the elections.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         The academy and free school leaders have demonstrated their appetite and commitment to leading our new, self-managing, self-improving education system, which augurs well for its success. And this means that many more children will have better outcomes as a result.

         The electorate was made up of headteachers of all academies in England open on 1 May 2014. Each headteacher was only able to vote in the election for the HTB covering the region in which their academy is located.
        </li>
        <li>
         The elections used a first-past-the-post system with conditions to ensure that at least one primary head and one secondary head is represented and to ensure that no more than one head per single academy chain is elected onto each board.

        <li>
