      Education Funding Agency (EFA) has developed a financing model for the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/psbp-overview">
       Priority School Building Programme
      </a>
      based upon the establishment of a funding vehicle known as the ‘aggregator’. One of the key features of the aggregator is the ability to warehouse loans and thereby aggregate total financing requirements across all the batches.
     </p>
     <p>
      There has been a high level of interest in the procurement and EFA is grateful to all consortia for the high quality submissions received throughout the procurement.
     </p>
     <p>
      EFA is pleased to announce that it signed a Funding Procurement Agreement with the aggregator on 5 November 2014. The aggregator is a wholly owned subsidiary of International Public Partnerships Limited, a FTSE 250 listed company, receives services from Amber Infrastructure Limited, and will have senior funding provided by Aviva and EIB.
     </p>
     <p>
      EFA now looks forward to working with the aggregator to fund the first of the private finance batches.
