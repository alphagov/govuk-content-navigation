        The Department for Education today
        <a href="/government/publications/destinations-of-key-stage-4-and-key-stage-5-pupils-2010-to-2011">
         published data
        </a>
        showing what proportion of students in every state-funded mainstream school, college and local authority in England progressed to further or higher education, or went into employment or training.
       </p>
       <p>
        The figures for universities are broken down to Oxbridge level, any Russell Group university, a university ranked in the top third (defined by the UCAS A level tariff score of entrants), or any higher education institution (HEI).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statistics, published as part of the government’s transparency agenda, give parents and the public even greater information with which they can choose the right school or college for their child.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, today’s statistics, which relate to maintained schools, further education colleges and sixth-form colleges, show what proportion and number of students were:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         in ‘sustained’ education and employment in the academic year 2010 to 2011, ie for at least 6 months, at age 16 and after they take A level or other level 3 qualifications
        </li>
        <li>
         at any higher education institution, a top third university, a Russell Group university or Oxbridge in the academic year 2010 to 2011
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Schools Minister David Laws said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         We are publishing this data so people can see for themselves how different schools, colleges and local authorities perform. Parents have more information than ever before on which to base decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
         These statistics demonstrate the gulf between the schools and colleges which deliver for their students - and those which do not.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some students will be aiming to get a job after college, others will be hoping to win a place at a great university. But all schools and colleges must ensure they deliver for all their students, whatever that student’s target.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         The package of reforms we are making to the education system will help all schools and colleges do this. We are toughening up GCSEs, delivering more support through the £2.5 billion pupil premium and expanding the academy system so more schools have strong leadership and performance.
        </p>

        Headline statistics
       </h2>
       <p>
        In the year after taking an A level or equivalent at key stage 5:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         62% of young people were in some form of sustained education, with 48% at a higher education institution (1% at Oxbridge, 8% at Russell Group universities, and 14% at top third universities).
        </li>
        <li>
         London local authorities dominate the table of those councils sending the highest proportion of students to university - Redbridge (66%), Ealing and Enfield (both 64%) top the list.
        </li>
        <li>
         Fewer than a third of students in schools or colleges in Portsmouth, Southampton and Bristol go to university.
        </li>
        <li>
         Only 3% of students attending schools or colleges in Knowsley and Rochdale go to a top third university. This compares to 41% of students at schools or colleges in Reading.
        </li>
        <li>
         Not a single student at schools or colleges in 8 local authorities - Sandwell, Islington, Barking and Dagenham, Swindon, Knowsley, Halton, Barnsley and Rochdale - attended Oxbridge.
        </li>
        <li>
         Reading (6%) and Bournemouth, Buckinghamshire and Sutton (all 3%) provided the highest proportion of Oxbridge students.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The statistics also highlight that in some local authorities, high levels of students drop out after they finish sixth form - only 56% of students in Norfolk were in any form of sustained education or employment/training. That compares with 81% of students in St Helens and Enfield who were in sustained education or employment/training.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the year after key stage 4:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         89% of young people were in sustained education or employment/training.
        </li>
        <li>
         82% of students in Nottingham and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and 83% in Wakefield and Sunderland were in any form of sustained education or employment/training.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        That compares to 95% in the Isles of Scilly, and 93% in Harrow, Sutton, Slough and Redbridge who were in sustained education or employment/training.

          This publication on ‘education and employment destination measures’ is classified as experimental statistics as the data is still being evaluated and remains subject to further testing in terms of their reliability and ability to meet customer needs.

          This statistical first release (SFR) reports on young people in key stage 4 (KS4) and key stage 5 (KS5) in the 2009 to 2010 academic year and identifies their education and employment or training destinations in the 2010 to 2011 academic year.

       </h3>
       <p>
        The 2009 to 2010 cohort is obtained from the published performance tables (PT) where young people are identified as being at the end of KS4. In the majority of schools, pupils in year 11 in the 2009 to 2010 school year were at the end of KS4, but some may have completed this key stage in an earlier or later year group.
       </p>
       <p>
        The base cohort includes students in state-funded mainstream schools in England only.
       </p>
       <h3 id="ks5">
        KS5
       </h3>
       <p>
        The 2009 to 2010 cohort is obtained from the published performance tables where young people aged 16, 17 or 18, were entered for A levels or other level 3 qualifications during the 2009 to 2010 academic year; this is otherwise referred to as ‘key stage 5’.
       </p>
       <p>
        The qualifications included in the tables are on the basis of their equivalence with A levels; A qualification’s ‘equivalence’ is quantified by looking at its size and the level of challenge it poses compared to an A level. An ‘AS’ is a level 3 qualification but students only get included in the cohort if they have undertaken a qualification equivalent to the size of an A level.
       </p>
       <p>
        The destination measures KS5 cohort is for state-funded mainstream schools plus the addition of further education colleges and sixth-form colleges.
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Creation of the destination measures requires higher education (HESA) data to be matched to the pupil data in the national pupil database. The HESA data used in this release are for the academic year 2010 to 2011 and these are the most recent data to have been matched. This publication is therefore reporting on 2009 to 2010 KS4 and KS5 (A level or equivalent qualification/s) students who went on to education destinations in the academic year 2010 to 2011.
