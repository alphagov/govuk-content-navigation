        EuroSkills is the largest European skills competition, which is taking place from 1 to 5 October in Lille, France.
       </p>
       <p>
        The UK are entering a team of 21 young apprentices and learners, all aged between 18 and 25, who will compete in 16 skills ranging from mechatronics to cooking.  They will be competing over 3 days of competition, against over 400 young people from throughout Europe.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the EuroSkills Competition, which is held every 2 years in one of the member states of WorldSkills Europe, international industry partners, governmental agencies and educational institutions come together to encourage world class standards of skills and competences in Europe.  By participating in the WorldSkills Competition the UK is able to share best practice in Apprenticeships and vocational teaching, raising standards on a global scale.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ross Maloney, Chief Executive, Find a Future, which manages the WorldSkills UK Skills Competitions and the UK’s entry into the international WorldSkills Competitions  said:  “Skills competitions showcase the high levels of performance that can be achieved by individuals and organisations through high quality further education, skills training and Apprenticeships.  Through skills competitions and the wider work of Find a Future we want to provide every young person with the chance to unlock their potential and get excited about the world of work.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Members of Team UK will also be competing at this year’s Skills Show, which runs from 13 to 15 November at NEC Birmingham. The Skills Show is the nation’s largest skills and careers event and provides hands-on experiences that inspire young people to explore careers and motivates them to find out more about the world of work.
