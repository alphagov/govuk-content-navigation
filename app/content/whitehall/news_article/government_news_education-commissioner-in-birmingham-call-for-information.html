        On 15 April 2014 Peter Clarke was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education to the role of education commissioner.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commissioner has been appointed to take an overview of evidence in relation to Birmingham schools and the allegations relating to the document publicly known as the ‘Trojan Horse letter’. He will work very closely with Ian Kershaw as adviser to Birmingham City Council to tackle this important issue and provide independent advice to the Secretary of State.
       </p>
       <p>
        There will be close co-operation between ongoing investigations by West Midlands Police and Ofsted. The commissioner will examine all evidence put to him and is expected to report by the summer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Should you have any information concerning issues related to Birmingham schools and the allegations being investigated and wish to come forward to the commissioner, please contact us by email or post.
