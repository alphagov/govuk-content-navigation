      The inspections are part of a concerted programme of action by Ofsted to establish the effectiveness of a Multi-Academy Trust in supporting and challenging academy schools within individual chains.
     </p>
     <p>
      Four academies were inspected as part of the focused inspection in mid–March. Two of the inspections were the academies’ first full inspection and two were monitoring inspections. The academies were all due for an inspection by the end of this academic year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Along with the inspections, telephone discussions were held with senior leaders in five other academies within the chain and inspectors undertook a follow-up visit to Collaborative’s national office. As part of this visit, discussions were held with the Chief Education and Operations Officer, members of staff and directors and strategic partners. Inspectors also scrutinised a range of relevant documentation and took account of data for individual academies and the trust as a whole, including previous inspection findings.

       clarifying the arrangements for the focused inspection of academies. In the first week, Ofsted inspects a number of the trust’s academies. Inspectors also hold telephone conversations with other academy principals. In the following week inspectors now visit Multi-Academy Trust central offices and hold discussions with staff from the trust. They consider a range of other evidence alongside the results from the focused inspections.

       Collaborative Academies Trust was set up in 2012 by EdisonLearning. There are currently nine academies in the trust. The first three, all in Northamptonshire, joined in November 2012 having previously worked with the sponsor as part of a local improvement partnership. A further three academies joined in April 2013, followed by another in January 2014. These four are all in Somerset. The remaining two academies joined at the beginning of this academic year. One is a new school in Somerset, the other is in Essex. All the academies, with the exception of Kingsthorpe College, are sponsored and primary schools. Seven of the eight predecessor schools had been judged as inadequate or requiring improvement at their last inspection before joining the trust.

       Kingsthorpe College, part of Collaborative Academies Trust, was inspected after the focused inspection and was judged ‘good’ in June.
