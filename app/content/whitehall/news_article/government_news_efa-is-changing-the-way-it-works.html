      EFA is changing the way it works to make things clearer, simpler and faster for our customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over the next 12 months EFA will be introducing a number of changes that will make it easier for you to find your information and carry out various tasks.
     </p>
     <p>
      As explained in recent e-bulletins, the EFA IM portal shuts on 20 March and all documents must be saved from there.
     </p>
     <p>
      From May there will be a new ‘document exchange’ system to allow the secure exchange of information between EFA and your institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      For that to work, EFA will be ask providers to sign up to the Department for Education’s ‘Secure Access’ system.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over the coming months there will be new electronic forms to make it easier to submit information in a standard way, the ability for you to see your remittance advice and other data, and an online calendar that will highlight forthcoming tasks and actions. EFA will use its
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/efa-e-bulletin">
       fortnightly e-bulletin
      </a>
      to let you know about changes to systems.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the first changes you can see: EFA has moved to GOV.UK, reducing the amount of information, and have re-written material to make it clearer and more task-oriented.
     </p>
     <p>
      GOV.UK works on the basis that most people will search, and you will find EFA information on the ‘departments and policy’ tab, but EFA’s main information is gathered into a number of ‘document collections’. They are:
