      An independent expert group, chaired by Stephen Munday
      <abbr title="Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire">
       CBE
      </abbr>
      , Chief Executive of Comberton Academy Trust, and the Teaching Schools Council have been commissioned to lead vital work to improve the quality of initial teacher training (
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      ) courses in England, the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan announced today (24 March 2015).
     </p>
     <p>
      On 19 January, Sir Andrew Carter published his review of the quality and effectiveness of
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      courses in England. The report highlighted that the system in England is performing well but that more needed to be done to ensure all trainees receive some core grounding in the basics of classroom management and subject knowledge. The report made 18 recommendations to government and the
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      In response to the report the government confirmed that it will:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        commission an independent working group made up of expert representatives from the sector to develop a core
        <abbr title="initial teacher training">
         ITT
        </abbr>
        framework - to support those who deliver
        <abbr title="initial teacher training">
         ITT
        </abbr>
        as well as applicants and trainees to have a better understanding of the essential elements of good
        <abbr title="initial teacher training">
         ITT
        </abbr>
        core content
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        commission the Teaching Schools Council to develop a new set of aspirational standards for school-based
        <abbr title="initial teacher training">
         ITT
        </abbr>
        mentors - to help promote the importance of the role and create a better shared understanding of the characteristics of effective mentoring across the
        <abbr title="initial teacher training">
         ITT
        </abbr>
        sector
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Announcing the formal appointment of the expert group and the Teaching Schools Council to take forward this important work today, Nicky Morgan said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I was really pleased that Sir Andrew Carter’s report highlighted that overall the
       <abbr title="initial teacher training">
        ITT
       </abbr>
       system in England is performing well.
      </p>
      <p>
       We want to continue to ensure we have excellent teachers in our classrooms to prepare young people for life in modern Britain. That is why we have committed to taking forward these important recommendations to help drive up improvements in the
       <abbr title="initial teacher training">
        ITT
       </abbr>
       system further.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       I’m delighted to appoint Stephen Munday to chair the independent expert group to lead the work on developing a new
       <abbr title="initial teacher training">
        ITT

       course content framework, and The Teaching Schools Council to develop new standards for
       <abbr title="initial teacher training">

       I am delighted to be able to work with colleagues on this really important development.

      Vicky Beer
      <abbr title="Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire">

      , Chair of the Teaching Schools Council, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       I am delighted that the Teaching Schools Council has been asked to lead on this really important work. Teaching Schools are at the heart of the government’s drive to give schools more freedom and to enable schools to take increasing responsibility for managing the education system. The Teaching Schools Council agree it is absolutely crucial for trainees to have high-quality, school-based mentoring to support them through their initial teacher training, and we look forward to working with teaching schools and
       <abbr title="initial teacher training">
        ITT
       </abbr>
       experts in developing national standards for mentors.
      </p>

     <p>
      We expect the independent expert group and the Teaching Schools Council will report to Ministers by the end of 2015.
