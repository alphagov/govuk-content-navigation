        The Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA) has today released 2010 key stage 2 national curriculum test results to the schools which administered the tests.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding the results, Education Secretary Michael Gove said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I am delighted that all national curriculum test results were made available to schools today.
        </p>
        <p>
         Almost three quarters of schools administered the tests this year, showing that the vast majority of headteachers did not support industrial action. Itâ€™s unfortunate parents and pupils in the schools that boycotted the tests will not benefit from the information that can be taken from test results.
        </p>
        <p>
         Rigorous external assessment provides the public and professionals with valuable objective data and plays a vital role in the accountability system.
        </p>
        <p>
         The best school systems generate rich quantities of information which enable us all to make meaningful comparisons, learn from the best and identify techniques which work.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do accept there are flaws with the current testing system so I am committed to reviewing national curriculum tests to ensure they are as rigorous as possible and in the best interests of schools, children, parents and the public.
        </p>
        <p>
         We want to consider what we can learn from other countries, to compare our tests with standards set elsewhere, and to look at how we can make the tests more useful.
        </p>
        <p>
         I believe headteachers and teachers will agree the solution to strengthening the tests is to work together and agree on how they can be reformed.
        </p>
        <p>
         While we work to improve and strengthen the tests, it is crucial that there is no gap in information provided to parents, pupils and teachers next year.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         I can therefore confirm that tests in 2011 will take place in the week commencing May 9.
        </p>
