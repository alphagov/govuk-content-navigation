      Apprenticeships and Skills Minister Robert Halfon said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Congratulations to every one of the National Apprenticeship regional finalists announced today. They are worthy ambassadors and a shining example of how becoming an apprentice is potentially life transforming -offering jobs and security for the future.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Apprenticeships are a ladder of opportunity for people of all backgrounds. They provide the skills and training our country needs and give employers the means to take their business from strength to strength.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Winners and highly commended entries from all regions across England will be recognised at one of 6 celebration events held across the country this autumn. After the regional ceremonies, winners will progress to the next stage of the competition, where their applications will be assessed by a national judging panel. National finalists will be announced in early December and will be invited to the national ceremony on 20 January 2017 at the Grosvenor House in London.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sue Husband, director, National Apprenticeship Service said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The National Apprenticeship Awards are a fantastic opportunity to celebrate the achievements of apprentices and the commitment of employers to apprenticeships. The regional finalists have shown their dedication to improving their own skills or those of their employees by pledging to support apprenticeships.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apprenticeships have a real impact on the skills of individuals, business performance and on the local and wider economy. Our awards showcase how apprenticeships develop a motivated, skilled and qualified workforce - for employers of all sizes - while improving productivity. Through an apprenticeship people of all ages can
       <a href="https://www.getingofar.gov.uk/" rel="external">
        ‘get in and go far’
       </a>
       to gain the skills and knowledge they need for a rewarding career.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       I congratulate every finalist on their apprenticeship achievements so far and wish them the very best of luck as the competition moves forward.
      </p>
