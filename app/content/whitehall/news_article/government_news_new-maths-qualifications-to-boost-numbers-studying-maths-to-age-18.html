        New high-quality maths qualifications will allow thousands more pupils to study the subject from age 16 to 18, Education Minister Elizabeth Truss today said.
       </p>
       <p>
        She said the new core maths qualifications would give young people the numeracy skills they needed to compete for jobs and high earnings, and would ensure future generations were strong in maths - a subject vital to so many careers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department for Education will spend £20 million from 2014 to 2016 on a programme to support schools and colleges to develop teaching for the new courses. To guide exam boards in developing new core maths qualifications, an expert panel convened by the Advisory Committee in Mathematics Education (
        <abbr title="Advisory Committee in Mathematics Education">
         ACME
        </abbr>
        ) has published guidelines today on what the courses should cover.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new core maths qualifications will suit students who achieve a B or C in
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        maths - usually around 50% of pupils every year, the vast majority of whom currently drop the subject afterwards. It will also be available for those with an A* and A grade who are not taking A or
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Subsidiary Level">
         AS level
        </abbr>
        maths.
       </p>
       <p>
        The International Baccalaureate Organisation announced today that an online version of its maths studies standard level course is to be developed for students in post-16 education from September 2015. This standard level course is already taught successfully to post-16 students in schools and colleges offering the International Baccalaureate (
        <abbr title="International Baccalaureate">
         IB
        </abbr>
        ) Diploma and will be made available more widely.
       </p>
       <p>
        Core maths courses will include topics like statistics, probability, advanced calculation and modelling, and will develop students’ mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills. The qualifications will also count as the maths element of the new TechBacc, to be introduced from September 2014 to recognise high performance by students in vocational education.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 16 to 18 core maths package is the latest part in the government’s top-to-bottom overhaul of maths in schools. It includes a rigorous new maths curriculum from age 5, and reformed maths
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Sducation">
         GCSEs
        </abbr>
        and
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Education Advanced Level">
         A levels
        </abbr>
        . Last month the government announced that students who reached the end of secondary school without a grade C or better in
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        maths would have to continue the subject in some way, up to the age of 18 or until they did achieve that qualification. The Department for Education is consulting on bringing in a new measure in the 16 to 19 performance tables which will show what proportion of students at colleges and school sixth forms achieve level 3 maths qualifications - equivalent to AS/
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
         A level
        </abbr>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Only a fifth of pupils in England currently carry on studying maths at any level after
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Sducation">
         GCSEs
        </abbr>
        - the lowest rate of 24 developed countries, behind Estonia, France, USA, Spain, Russia and China, according to a 2010 report by the Nuffield Foundation. In Japan, approximately 85% of young people study maths to the equivalent of
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
         A level
        </abbr>
        . In Chinese Taipei, South Korea and Hong Kong - examples of high-performing countries - maths is compulsory in ‘upper secondary’ (16 to 19) education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most students who do carry on with maths in England to a higher level are A-grade students – 71% of those who got an A* or A in
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        maths in 2012 studied maths post-16. But almost all other pupils drop the subject after
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        because of the lack of appropriate maths courses for them to take – only 33% of students who got a B, and just 24% of those with a C, studied any maths post-16, often at a level below
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The amount of time spent teaching maths in England is also low - we are 39th out of 42 countries, with 116 hours a year spent teaching maths at age 14. This compares with 166 hours a year spent teaching maths in Chinese Taipei, 138 hours in Singapore, 138 hours in Hong Kong and 137 hours in South Korea – some of the highest performing education jurisdictions (
        <abbr title="Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study">
         TIMSS
        </abbr>
        2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Alongside low participation, international tables show that England’s performance in maths has stagnated at ages 10, 14 and 15, while 30% of businesses in the
        <abbr title="Confederation of British Industry">
         CBI
        </abbr>
        ’s Education and Skills Survey last year reported dissatisfaction with the standard of school and college leavers’ numeracy. Some 68% of employers said they wanted both maths and science promoted more in schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        Research shows the importance of maths to people’s careers. Those with
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
         A level
        </abbr>
        maths earn between 7% and 10% more than similarly skilled workers who do not have the qualification. A study by Deloitte last year showed that the economic return from maths science jobs was £74,000 on average compared to the national mean of £36,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        Elizabeth Truss said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The evidence is clear, maths is vital to getting on in life. Careers increasingly demand strong numeracy and reasoning. We need far more of our young people going to university and into work with these skills.
        </p>
        <p>
         England lags behind the world in maths, both in performance and participation. This is a real risk to our economic growth and future prosperity.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         This is why we are supporting organisations to develop these maths qualifications. They will mean thousands more young people will now study the subject to age 18 and be able to compete in the global jobs market.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Professor Jeremy Hodgen of King’s College London said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Mathematical problem-solving and modelling is becoming increasingly important in the workplace and in higher education. It is essential young people with
         <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">

         </abbr>
         study maths for longer to develop greater understanding. These proposals present an exciting opportunity for young people to develop this capacity to apply and use mathematics.

       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         With the number of UK students studying mathematics beyond 16 significantly lower than many other countries, there is an urgent need to take action to ensure that future generations of young people have the mathematics and problem-solving skills required to keep the UK internationally competitive. In today’s global marketplace, both universities and employers need to be confident that the people they are recruiting are on a par with their international counterparts when it comes to standards in mathematics. But to bring the discipline to life and inspire young people to continue in the subject, we must make sure we embed the study of mathematics in the context of other disciplines and the real world - something which is at the very heart of the
         <abbr title="International Baccalaureate">

         Whatever path young people choose, they will face situations where they need to be competent and confident in dealing with numbers, data and graphs.

The report contains an excellent, well-defined list of outcomes for students, which includes reference to confidence and positive attitudes. We look forward to the development of courses that deliver these outcomes, that take real-life problems as their starting point and that address areas such as financial capability that are crucial for all young people.
