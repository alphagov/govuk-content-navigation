      Skills Minister Matthew Hancock has today (24 March 2014) announced the appointment of David Meller as the new Chair of the
      <a href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk" rel="external">
       National Apprenticeship Ambassadors Network
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      David is Chair of the Meller group, one of the largest luxury home and beauty suppliers in the UK, a non-executive board member for the Department for Education, and sponsors 5 academies and 2 university technical colleges, through the Meller Educational Trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said: “I am delighted that David Meller has accepted the post of Chair of the National Apprenticeship Ambassadors Network.
     </p>
     <p>
      “His wealth of knowledge and experience will be a valuable asset to the Network, the purpose of which is to grow the apprenticeship programme through positive promotion of apprenticeships to employers.”
     </p>
     <p>
      David Meller said:  “For me the benefits of apprenticeships are numerous, increased productivity, greater staff retention and more highly motivated workforces. Apprentices have contributed to the increased effectiveness of many businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      “I’m looking forward to working with the Minister, the Network and the National Apprenticeship Service to promote all aspects of apprenticeships, especially the developing areas of traineeships, higher levels and new sectors. I will be attending my first meeting of the Network today.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The National Apprenticeship Ambassadors Network is an employer-led body. Its remit is to encourage more employers to become involved in apprenticeships in England. It is a group of senior business leaders from FTSE 100/250 businesses and small and medium sized enterprises across the public and private sectors who have seen the value that apprenticeships add to our businesses.

        The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries.’ It set 4 ambitions in the ‘Plan for Growth’, published at Budget 2011:
       </p>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <ul>
      <li>
       to create the most competitive tax system in the G20
      </li>
      <li>
       to make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business
      </li>
      <li>
       to encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy
      </li>
      <li>
       to create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth  Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.
