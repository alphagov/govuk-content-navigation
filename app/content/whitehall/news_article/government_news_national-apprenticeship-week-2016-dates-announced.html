      Co-ordinated by the Skills Funding Agency, the week will include hundreds of events and activities across England to showcase apprentices and apprentice employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apprenticeships are thriving in England and National Apprenticeship Week will celebrate the positive impact that both apprenticeships and traineeships have on individuals, businesses and the wider economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers, apprentices, business support organisations, colleges and training organisations and schools across the country will be encouraged to support the week by hosting activities to showcase the achievements and benefits of apprenticeships.
     </p>
     <p>
      The government is committed to 3 million apprenticeship starts over the next 5 years and this ambition will be a key driver for

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers take on apprentices throughout the year, but National Apprenticeship Week is about celebrating the crucial role that apprenticeships and traineeships play in upskilling the nation and increasing productivity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last year’s week aimed to encourage more small and medium sized businesses to take on apprentices and promote the range and breadth of apprenticeships on offer, including those at higher level and within blue chip companies.  Successes included another 200 businesses joining the

      to design high quality apprenticeships and also the launch of

       23,000 apprenticeship vacancies were pledged

      and the ambition for National Apprenticeship Week 2016 will be to better this.

      Sue Husband, Director of the National Apprenticeship Service commented,
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Last year’s National Apprenticeship Week saw some tremendous achievements, but I want next year’s National Apprenticeship Week to be the best yet. I am looking forward to once again raising the profile of apprenticeships and traineeships and celebrating the important role they play in equipping people of all ages with the skills that they need to prosper in their lives.
