        A further 4 experts have been appointed to support vital work to boost the quality of initial teacher training (
        <abbr title="initial teacher training">
         ITT
        </abbr>
        ) courses across England and ensure all trainees learn essential skills such as classroom management and assessment, Schools Minister Nick Gibb announced today (24 September 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In March, Stephen Munday
        <abbr title="Commander of the Order of the British Empire">
         CBE
        </abbr>
        , Chief Executive of Comberton Academy Trust, was appointed to chair an independent expert group that would develop a new core content framework for
        <abbr title="initial teacher training">
         ITT
        </abbr>
        courses.
       </p>
       <p>
        The group was commissioned following the publication in January of
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/carter-review-of-initial-teacher-training">
         Sir Andrew Carter’s review of the quality and effectiveness of
         <abbr title="initial teacher training">
          ITT
         </abbr>
         courses in England
        </a>
        . While Sir Andrew’s report highlighted that overall the
        <abbr title="initial teacher training">
         ITT
        </abbr>
        system in England was performing well, he outlined that more could be done to ensure all trainees received some core grounding in the basics of classroom management and subject knowledge.
       </p>
       <p>
        The development of a core framework will support those who deliver
        <abbr title="initial teacher training">
         ITT
        </abbr>
        as well as applicants and trainees to have a better understanding of the key elements of good
        <abbr title="initial teacher training">
         ITT
        </abbr>
        content.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, the minister has appointed additional experts from a diverse range of backgrounds to support the group. They are:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Rachael Hare - Head of Initial Teacher Education at Harris Federation
        </li>
        <li>
         Patrick Derham - Headmaster of Westminster School
        </li>
        <li>
         John McIntosh
         <abbr title="Commander of the Order of the British Empire">
          CBE
         </abbr>
         - former Headmaster of the London Oratory School
        </li>
        <li>
         Professor Anthony O’Hear - Director of the Royal Institute of Philosophy, University of Buckinghamshire
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Commenting on the new appointments, Nick Gibb said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         We want to continue to ensure we have excellent teachers in our classrooms so that every child can reach their full potential. Making sure trainees learn essential skills such as classroom management and have a good grounding in subject knowledge are vital to this, and will help drive up improvements in the
         <abbr title="initial teacher training">
          ITT
         </abbr>
         system further.
        </p>

        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/initial-teacher-training-review">
         In response to Sir Andrew Carter’s report
        </a>
        , which made 18 recommendations to government and the
        <abbr title="initial teacher training">
         ITT
        </abbr>
        sector, the government confirmed that it would:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         commission an independent working group made up of expert representatives from the sector to develop a core
         <abbr title="initial teacher training">
          ITT

         framework - to support those who deliver
         <abbr title="initial teacher training">

         core content

        <li>
         commission the
         <a href="http://tscouncil.org.uk/" rel="external">
          Teaching Schools Council
         </a>
         to develop a new set of aspirational standards for school-based
         <abbr title="initial teacher training">
          ITT

         mentors - to help promote the importance of the role and create a better shared understanding of the characteristics of effective mentoring across the

         sector
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The Teaching Schools Council, was appointed in March to lead the work to develop new standards for
        <abbr title="initial teacher training">
         ITT
        </abbr>
        mentors.
       </p>
       <p>
        We expect the independent expert group and the Teaching Schools Council will report to ministers by spring 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        In response to the Carter review the government also committed to develop the
        <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/get-into-teaching" rel="external">
         Get Into Teaching website
        </a>
