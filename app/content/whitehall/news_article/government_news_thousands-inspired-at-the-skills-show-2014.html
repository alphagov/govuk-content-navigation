      The show, now in its third year, welcomed 73,858 visitors during its three-day run and featured a wide range of hands-on experiences and skills competitions designed to help shape the futures of those who attended.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Delivering a high quality, memorable experience is of paramount importance to all those involved in the staging of The Skills Show, and I am confident that 2014’s event was our best yet,” says Ross Maloney, Chief Executive of Find a Future, which oversees the event as well as the WorldSkills UK Skills Competitions, the finals of which were held at the NEC alongside the Show.
     </p>
     <p>
      A new, more open show floor design for 2014 enabled visitors to the show to move freely between areas, and ensured that WorldSkills UK competitors were more visible to observers.
     </p>
     <p>
      64 WorldSkills UK Skills Competitions reached their national finals at The Skills Show, with 588 finalists showing off their abilities to be recognised as the very best young talent in the country.  Medals were presented at a ceremony on Saturday, hosted by TV presenter Will Best.
     </p>
     <p>
      Keith Smith, Executive Director of Funding and Programmes at the Skills Funding Agency, gave a speech in his role as UK Official Delegate for WorldSkills International and Europe.
     </p>
     <p>
      New for 2014, showcase areas linked to WorldSkills UK Skills Competitions enabled those watching to understand what was happening, and become inspired by the young competitors, while a comprehensive programme of Spotlight talks across the event provided real-life insights into careers from “real people doing real jobs”, as well as famous names from the world of business and industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Independent careers advice and training information was available throughout the event, with advisers placed alongside leading employer brands to inspire and encourage young people on the road to work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another highlight of the show was the “Have a Go” concept – an opportunity to try “bite-sized” skills experiences – which once again this proved extremely popular with visitors of all ages, who were keen to try careers as varied as bricklaying, floristry, web design and media make up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ross Maloney added:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Walking through the halls at the NEC, it was clear that The Skills Show engages and excites young people with a wide range of different activities and this engagement is something we are keen to reinforce and build on for 2015 and beyond.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Date for your diary: The Skills Show will return to the NEC from 19 to 21 November 2015.
