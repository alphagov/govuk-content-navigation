       <p>
        In total, 47 teams took part in the challenge and whilst doing so, recruited over 80 businesses to start offering apprenticeships. The teams also delivered 47 community projects, from planting a community orchard to the refurbishment of a cliff shelter and through more than 300 school visits, encouraged other young people to consider an apprenticeship.
       </p>
       <p>
        The finalists will now continue their fundraising and awareness raising activities through to early July, when they will then take part in the logistical and teambuilding finale.
       </p>
       <p>
        The apprentice team of the year will be announced on 8 July at Brathay Trust’s Windermere headquarters.
       </p>

        In addition to the work of the finalists, economists at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) have estimated that the Brathay Apprentice Challenge 2015 has driven £3.1m* in additional GDP to the UK economy.

        Commenting on the challenge, Sue Husband, Director of the National Apprenticeship Service, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         The quality of work we see from apprentices increases year on year and it’s great to see so many organisations taking part in the

         </a>
         . Apprenticeships are important to both businesses and young people as they allow businesses to grow their own talent and young people to earn while they learn in a real job while gaining a real qualification.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        *The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) estimate that each apprenticeship created is worth c.£38k to the economy in the long term, the Brathay Apprentice Challenge created 83 new potential employers so 83 x £38,000 = £3,154,000.
