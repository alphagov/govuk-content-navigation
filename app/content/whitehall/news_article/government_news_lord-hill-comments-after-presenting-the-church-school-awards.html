      Following the first ever Church School Awards, held in London on 24 March 2011, Schools Minister Lord Hill said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I am delighted to congratulate the regional and national winners of the first ever Church School Awards on their superb work. These schools have demonstrated their commitment to respecting and supporting other young people around the world as well as in their own local community.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Church schools make an important contribution to education in this country - not only in achieving good exam results, but also in nurturing young people to become real ambassadors for the ethos of their schools. It is wonderful to be able to celebrate this and see the links they have established in volunteering in local communities, fundraising for countries hit by disaster and building relationships with pupils around the world.
      </p>
