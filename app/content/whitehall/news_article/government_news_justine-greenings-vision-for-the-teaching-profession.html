      In a
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/justine-greening-teachers-the-experts-driving-social-mobility">
       speech
      </a>
      at the Chartered College of Teaching’s inaugural conference, Education Secretary Justine Greening set out her ambition for a high-status teaching profession, backed up by high-quality continued professional development and pledged her support for teachers as the body of experts who are key to driving social mobility.
     </p>
     <p>
      Addressing an audience of over 450 teachers, Justine Greening described the launch of new the College of Teaching as a historic moment for the teaching profession. Commenting on the launch she said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Teaching deserves all the hallmarks of the other great professions - with a high bar to entry, high-quality initial training and a culture of ongoing self-improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it’s crucial that, like other experts, teachers now have a professional body with a shared commitment to ever-improving standards, disseminating evidence on what works, and driving progress for the profession as a whole.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       And I especially want to see a new generation of teachers becoming part of the Chartered College of Teaching - to help safeguard and shape the profession’s future.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The Education Secretary also outlined plans to strengthen the teaching profession so that every child has access to an excellent teacher, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       making absolutely clear that
       <abbr title="qualified teacher status">
        QTS
       </abbr>
       will not be scrapped - instead, the government will work with the sector to develop and introduce a newly strengthened
       <abbr title="qualified teacher status">
        QTS
       </abbr>
       from September 2019, so that all school leaders will want all their teaching staff to achieve it
      </li>
      <li>
       announcing the first round of bidding for the £75 million Teaching and Leadership Innovation Fund - to enable new, high-quality continued professional development (
       <abbr title="continued professional development">
        CPD
       </abbr>
       ) provision to be delivered where it can make the most difference, including in the 12 opportunity areas
      </li>
      <li>
       new, fully revised gold-standard national professional qualifications (
       <abbr title="national professional qualifications">
        NPQs
       </abbr>
       ), developed in partnership with the teaching profession, to  be implemented from September this year. £10 million from the Teaching and Leadership Innovation Fund will be made available to incentivise take-up of the new
       <abbr title="national professional qualifications">
        NPQs
       </abbr>
       for high-potential professionals working in the most challenging schools
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Underlining the importance she placed on ensuring teachers have the right support and skills so they are able to help all young people fulfil their potential, the Secretary of State said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Teachers are the great drivers of social mobility in our country. We know that the single biggest in-school influence on a child’s life chances is the quality of teaching they receive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important that all teachers are supported with the right framework that will allow them to become the best professionals they possibly can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to work with the profession to make sure this happens, with a golden thread through every teacher’s career from initial training and
       <abbr title="qualified teacher status">
        QTS
       </abbr>
       through continued professional development, especially in those early post-
       <abbr title="qualified teacher status">
        QTS
       </abbr>
       years, through to specialism or leadership.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Great teaching transformed my life, and I want to make sure that happens for today’s generation of children in our schools. I will do all I can to ensure teachers have the right support that will enable them to spread opportunity for children and young people - particularly those who need it most.
