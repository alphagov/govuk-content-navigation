      Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt MP and Chinese Vice Premier, Liu Yandong co-chaired the Dialogue at the Shanghai Tower.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Dialogue is a key pillar in the UK-China relationship, celebrating links between the two peoples. Policy strands for this year’s dialogue were education, science, health, tourism, sport, culture and creative industries, youth and regional cooperation, bringing together key themes of creativity, social equity and women’s equality.
     </p>
     <p>
      Headline announcements at today’s Dialogue include the signing of the new UK-China TV Co-Production Treaty,  making the UK only the second country in the world to have both film and television treaties with China; a Memorandum of Understanding on UK-China Antimicrobial Resistance Research and Innovation Collaboration; the signing of a new Host-to-Host agreement for cooperation on the Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics 2022; and the British Library  and National Library of China collaborating to display some of Britain’s most iconic literary treasures in China, including Shakespeare’s First Folio.
     </p>
     <p>
      Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt MP said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The UK-China High Level People to People Dialogue is about strengthening the collaboration between our two countries, building partnerships that benefit people in both our nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the UK and China have energetic economies, with innovation and creativity at the core. We are both global powers with a global outlook. In a golden era for our two nations, we are working together on global issues, building economies for the future, and developing our strong trade, investment and people-to-people links. The People-to-People Dialogue is an opportunity to deepen our engagement across policies central to the growth and prosperity of both our nations.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       We have a shared commitment to ensuring the bilateral relationship delivers for all our people – linking UK towns and cities with their Chinese counterparts is a key part of this and I’m delighted that the Northern Ireland First Minister is here in Shanghai with us today.  We’ve also agreed to step up UK-China collaboration on women’s equality and empowerment making this a fundamental element of our Global Partnership.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      In addition to Jeremy Hunt MP, the UK official delegation included Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities, Justine Greening; Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Karen Bradley; Northern Ireland First Minister, Arlene Foster; and the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy’s Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor John Loughhead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Secretary of State for Education, Justine Greening, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       The UK and China share many priorities in the field of education, and we both recognise and highly value the benefits of international collaboration. Today’s agreements demonstrate our ongoing commitment to working together to build on the strong foundation we have laid over the past decades. As our bilateral relationship develops, the outcomes of today’s agreements, by providing us with opportunities to share ideas and expertise, will allow us to prosper together.
      </p>

     </h3>
     <p>
      The UK-China Television Coproduction Treaty is a landmark agreement which will help to develop collaboration between both countries’ industries. The UK is now only the second country in the world to have both film and television treaties with China. The Treaty will help to create programmes that combine cultural characteristics of both countries and it will deliver a boon of around £55m per year for the UK television industry by helping them to access the burgeoning Chinese market.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The British Museum is honoured to present A History of the World in 100 Objects: the Exhibition in Beijing. Inspired by the highly-acclaimed 2010 radio series and book, which was produced in partnership with the BBC and Penguin Books, this unique exhibition sets out to tell one version of an extraordinary story - the history of the world. It is not told through writing, but through objects: the creations and inventions that people have made, and that have helped us to overcome the challenges that humankind has faced throughout the last 2 million years. The exhibition A History of the World in 100 Objects will be displayed in Beijing in 2017.

The £1.6 million project was funded by the UK Government as part of an ambitious cultural exchange programme with China.
