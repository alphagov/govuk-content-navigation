        Data released today (26 January 2015) reveals a 28% increase in apprenticeship vacancies posted online on the apprenticeship vacancies website between August and October 2014 (academic year Q1 2014 to 2015) compared to the same period the previous year. 46,920 vacancies were advertised over the 3 months versus 36,690 in 2013 to 2014. This is in addition to thousands more opportunities offered by employers to young people directly.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were noticeable rises in the number of apprenticeship vacancies within the vital STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) fields.  Apprenticeship vacancies advertised online in Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies and Information and Communication Technology both recorded a 23% increase on the same period last year.

        Skills Minister Nick Boles said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Apprenticeships are at the heart of the Government’s drive to equip people with the skills employers want and need.  We want it to become the new norm for people to choose between an apprenticeship or University as equally prestigious routes to a great career. That is why it’s so encouraging to see even more excellent apprenticeship opportunities available across the country.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        National Apprenticeship Awards winner, Griffon Hoverwork, is just one employer offering STEM related apprenticeships. Mike Chalkley, Engineering Director, Griffon Hoverwork, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         We are champions of apprenticeships and are doing all we can to raise their profile within the marine industry and beyond. We’ve seen the benefits of apprenticeships to our business and want to encourage others to take action and reap the same rewards.
        </p>
