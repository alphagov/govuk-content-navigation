      Ofqual is pleased to confirm that all
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accreditation-of-gcses-as-a-levels-for-teaching-from-2016">
       specifications for GCSE, AS and A level subjects to be taught from September 2016
      </a>
      have now been accredited.
     </p>
     <p>
      The process is underway for accrediting GCSEs, AS and A levels for first teaching from September 2017. The first of those qualifications has been accredited.
     </p>
     <p>
      As with the 2016 subjects, we have produced a 2017 table which shows
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accreditation-of-gcses-as-a-levels-for-teaching-from-2017/gcse-as-and-a-level-subjects-accredited-to-be-taught-from-2017">
       the status of specifications submitted to Ofqual
      </a>
      . The table will be updated as soon as there is any change in either the submission date or the specification status.
     </p>
     <p>
      Accreditation is the last stage of a necessarily lengthy and involved process that involves the development of content and regulatory requirements that all new GCSEs, AS and A levels must meet, as explained by Julie Swan, Executive Director for General Qualifications, in her

       blog about the third phase of accreditation
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Last year, Phil Beach our Director of Strategic Relationships for General Qualifications wrote a

       blog about our accreditation process
      </a>
      . The blog is still relevant and is a good starting point for anyone wanting to understand all the stages of accreditation.
