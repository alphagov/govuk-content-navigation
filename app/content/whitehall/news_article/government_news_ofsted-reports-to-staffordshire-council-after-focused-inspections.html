        The focused inspections are part of a concerted programme of action by Ofsted to establish why children in some parts of the country have a much lower chance of attending a good or better school than their peers in other similar areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Staffordshire, Ofsted’s main concern centres on the progress made by pupils at primary school whereby a large number of schools do not yet provide their pupils with a good education. Of the 18 primary schools that were inspected:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         2 were judged outstanding
        </li>
        <li>
         7 judged good
        </li>
        <li>
         6 judged requires improvement
        </li>
        <li>
         3 judged special measures – these schools had declined from a previous good judgement
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        During the inspections, Ofsted also gathered information on the use, quality and impact of Staffordshire Council’s support for school improvement by asking additional key questions of headteachers and governors.

        <a href="http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/local-authorities/staffordshire" rel="external">
         letter sent to the local authority
        </a>
        has been published online.
       </p>
       <ol>

         <p>
          The letter to Staffordshire Council can be found on Ofsted’s website.

          The schools inspected were: Kingsfield First School; Hob Hill CE/Methodist (VC) Primary School; All Saints CofE (A) First School; Leek First School; Springcroft Primary School; Silkmore Community Primary School; St Saviour’s CofE (VC) Primary School; St Paul’s CofE (C) Primary School; St Patrick’s Catholic Primary School; Bhylls Acre Primary School; Hayes Meadow Primary School; Castlechurch Primary School; St Chad’s CofE (C) Primary School; Our Lady and St Werburgh’s Catholic Primary School; Mary Howard CofE (VC) Primary School; Amington Heath Primary School and Nursery; St Margaret’s CofE (C) Junior School; and Thomas Barnes Primary School.

          On 17 January 2013, Ofsted announced the first wave of focused school inspections across local authority areas, where children are being denied the standard of education they deserve.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Local authority areas were selected for the focused school inspection programme on the basis of the relative proportion of children attending good or better primary schools, as set out in the last Ofsted Annual Report, and Ofsted data on the proportion of children attending good or better secondary schools, as well as any relevant inspection evidence gathered during the autumn 2012 term. These are standard section 5 inspections, which were scheduled to take place this academic year and include all types of schools – although the majority will be primary schools.
