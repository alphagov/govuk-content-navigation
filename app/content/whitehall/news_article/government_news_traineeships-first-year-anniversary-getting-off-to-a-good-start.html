      Traineeships are off to a good start as we mark the first year anniversary, with 7,400* learners being recorded as starting a Traineeship programme in the first three quarters of the 2013 to 2014 academic year.**
     </p>
     <p>
      Throughout the first year, we continue to see commitment and enthusiasm from both training providers and national employers including, Barclays, BT, the National Grid and the BBC, on signing up to the Traineeship programme.
     </p>
     <p>
      To mark the first year anniversary, the

      and

       Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
      </a>
      have signed a joint statement of support for those wanting to take part in the Traineeship programme.
     </p>
     <p>
      Skills Minister Nick Boles said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Traineeships are already proving a great stepping stone into apprenticeships and other jobs, so I am delighted the TUC and CBI have come together to support the scheme. It is essential for employers to make sure that trainees have a high quality experience and gain valuable skills that will benefit them for their whole careers.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Household names such as BT, the BBC and Siemens have already got involved alongside many smaller employers. This agreement should encourage even more businesses to sign up and provide opportunities for young people to gain the work experience and knowledge needed to begin their careers.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
