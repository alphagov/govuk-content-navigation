      The work of the Department for Education lies at the heart of the government’s drive to extend opportunity and deliver real social justice. Our goal is to provide world-class education and care that allows every child and young person to reach his or her potential, regardless of background. We have already come a long way; with over 1.4 million more children in ‘good’ and ‘outstanding’ schools than in 2010, reflecting the dedication and hard work of teachers and pupils everywhere.
     </p>
     <p>
      There will be questions about how the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/eu-referendum">
       EU referendum
      </a>
      result affects our reforms to education and social care. As the Prime Minister has set out, the government will continue to deliver its manifesto commitments, and will continue taking forward the important legislation set out in the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/queens-speech-2016">
       Queen’s Speech
      </a>
      . The usual business of government will also continue - ensuring a high-quality school place for every child, recruiting and training the best teachers, tackling underperformance wherever it occurs, and keeping children safe.
     </p>
     <p>
      There will be no immediate changes in the circumstances of European citizens living, studying or working in the UK - current arrangements will continue to apply to European pupils and their families, and to teachers, early years and social work professionals and all others who work with children.
     </p>
     <p>
      All schools will continue to play an important role in promoting the fundamental British values of mutual respect and tolerance for those of all backgrounds and faiths. We are clear that no child should live in fear of racism or bullying, and by law all schools must have a behaviour policy with measures to tackle bullying.
