       <p>
        The government has today (25 October 2016) set out how apprenticeships will be funded as part of the drive to help millions get the skills they need for a successful career and make Britain a country that works for everyone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Apprenticeships give people more control over their lives and can be the difference between just about managing and pursuing a skilled, long-term career. The government wants to give everyone this opportunity, regardless of their background or where they live, which is why we are giving more support for 16- to 18-year-olds and those from disadvantaged areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The funding policy will underpin the new apprenticeship levy, which will deliver much needed investment in the skills we need to change the lives of millions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government will continue to work with employers and providers as it introduces the reforms, to help ensure we transform our country’s skills for the benefit of all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Main measures confirmed today:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         more support for younger apprentices and disadvantaged people:
         <ul>
          <li>
           100% of training costs will be paid by government for employers with fewer than 50 employees who take on apprentices aged 16 to 18 years old. This will also apply to smaller employers who take on 19- to 24-year-olds who were in care or 19- to 24-year-olds with an
           <a href="https://www.gov.uk/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help">
            education and health care plan
           </a>
          </li>
          <li>
           £1,000 each from government to employers and training providers who take on 16- to 18-year-olds and 19- to 24-year-olds who were in care or who have an education and health care plan
          </li>
          <li>
           providers that train 16- to 18-year-olds on apprenticeship frameworks will be given an additional cash payment equal to 20% of the funding band maximum in order to help them to adapt to the new, simpler funding model
          </li>
          <li>
           providers that train apprentices from the most deprived areas on apprenticeship frameworks will continue to receive additional funding from government. More than £60 million will be invested in supporting the training of apprentices from the poorest areas in the country, equalling around one third of all apprentices. It is vital that we make sure that these funds are being invested in the right way, which is why we will conduct a fuller review into how to support individuals from all backgrounds into apprenticeships in future. This will look at the support employers should receive, as well as providers, and conclude next year.
          </li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
         more flexibility for employers:
         <ul>
          <li>
           longer for employers to spend funds in their digital account, now with 24 months before they expire, an increase from government’s original proposal of just 18 months
          </li>
          <li>
           a commitment to introducing the ability for employers to transfer digital funds to other employers in their supply chains, sector or to apprenticeship training agencies in 2018, with a new employer group including the Confederation of British Industry, Federation of Small Businesses, British Chambers of Commerce, Charity Finance Group and EEF - the manufacturers’ organisation - to help government develop this system so that it works for employers
          </li>
          <li>
           more funding for
           <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">
            STEM
           </abbr>
           apprenticeship frameworks and higher pricing of apprenticeship standards to support improved quality, and providing greater flexibility to train those with prior qualifications. This will support the industrial strategy and provide wider opportunities for more individuals to develop new skills
          </li>
         </ul>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Skills Minister Robert Halfon said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Apprenticeships work. The reforms we are rolling out will guarantee support from employers and government, so that millions of people can get the apprenticeships, skills and jobs for the future.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Our apprenticeship levy will boost our economic productivity, increase our skills base and give millions a leg up on the ladder of opportunity - over 90% of apprentices currently go into work or further training. Making Britain a world leader on apprenticeships is essential if we truly want a country that works for everyone.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        To ensure higher-quality apprenticeships, the government has also introduced a new
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers">
         register of apprenticeship training providers
        </a>
        , which opens today. All providers on the register will have to pass quality and financial tests. Those with an ‘inadequate’ Ofsted rating for apprenticeship provision will not be eligible to apply to the register.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/views-sought-on-plans-to-boost-apprenticeships">
         apprenticeship funding policy was outlined in August
        </a>
        . It will underpin the levy which will be paid by employers will a pay bill of more than £3 million and will put the funding of apprenticeships on a sustainable long-term footing so we can support opportunities for all.
       </p>
       <p>
        The measures announced today are the first steps in upskilling the nation by giving millions a leg up on the ladder of opportunity to high-quality jobs, and giving employers the skills they desperately need.

        Notes to editors
       </h2>
       <ol>
        <li>
         The proposal to pay 90% of apprenticeship training costs will apply to more than 98% of employers in England that won’t pay the levy when it is introduced in 2017.
        </li>
        <li>
         By 2019 to 2020 government spending on apprenticeships in England will be double the level of spending in 2010 to 2011.
        </li>
        <li>
         In March 2016 the government published
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-levy-how-it-will-work">
          a guide for employers on how they will pay the levy, access the digital system and pay for apprenticeships in future
         </a>
         . This has been updated with the latest information for employers.
        </li>
        <li>
         To help employers see how the levy and funding system will work for them, the government has created an online calculator. The simple-to-use tool will enable employers to understand how much levy they will pay and how they could use their digital funds to pay for training in future.
        </li>
        <li>
         The apprenticeship funding system will be made up of 15 bands, each with an upper limit ranging from £1,500 to £27,000. The upper limit of each funding band will cap the maximum amount of digital funds an employer who pays the levy can use towards an individual apprenticeship or that the government will co-invest. All existing and new apprenticeship frameworks and standards will be placed within one of these funding bands and it will be up to employers to negotiate prices with providers.
        </li>
        <li>
         The register of apprenticeship training providers will open for applications today. Providers who want to deliver less than £100,000 of apprenticeship training per year as a subcontractor can choose to apply for the register but it will not be compulsory. We have also launched a procurement for apprenticeship delivery for smaller employers who will not pay the levy.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Colleges, employers and other organisations have been lending their support to the apprenticeship levy.

       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         High-quality apprenticeships are vital to our economic growth, and to young workers looking for a decent start to their career. The levy will give a welcome boost to funding for apprenticeships, and will make sure that all employers who benefit from a skilled workforce are paying their way. Trade unions look forward to working with employers to make a success of the levy and the apprenticeships that it funds.

We are looking forward to working in collaboration with all employers to support them with their staffing needs.

        <p>
         A recent CMI survey of over 1,000 managers showed strong support for the apprenticeship levy, and 80% of managers agree there needs to be far greater investment in higher level skills to meet the massive economic and employment challenges that we’ll face post-Brexit. Bad management currently costs British businesses £84 billion a year in lost productivity, leaving us lagging behind our G7 competitors. We clearly need to use the opportunities of the levy to ensure that we have the future skills such as management and digital that employers are crying out for.
