        Jade, aged 23, a manufacturing engineer with MBDA UK, fought off competition from hundreds of other apprentices around England to be awarded the top prize.
       </p>
       <p>
        The awards, now in their twelfth year, are run by the National Apprenticeship Service and recognise excellence in two areas: businesses that grow their own talent with apprentices and apprentices who have made a significant contribution to their workplaces.
       </p>
       <p>
        Skills Minister Nick Boles said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Congratulations to Jade for your success at the National Apprenticeship Awards. Apprenticeships truly are set to be one of the great success stories of the decade, and Jade is a worthy ambassador.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         We are committed to 3 million apprenticeships by 2020 so that even more young people can follow Jade’s lead and reap the benefits of apprenticeships.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Employment Minister Priti Patel said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to Jade for her fantastic achievement in being named the Nuclear Decommissioning Site Licence Companies Higher Apprentice of the Year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Apprenticeships offer a fantastic way for many young people of all backgrounds to earn as they learn while providing employers with the transferable skills needed to take their business from strength to strength. We currently have record-breaking levels of employment – and this is boosted by prospects like apprenticeships. I want to see this continue.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         By working closely with businesses and taking steps like rolling out our ‘Jobcentre Plus Support for Schools’ programme to teach pupils about work experience, apprenticeships and traineeships, we are helping to create an even more flexible and resilient labour market for the future.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Jade was chosen as the winner in recognition of the outstanding contribution she has made to MBDA UIK since joining as an apprentice in 2011.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jade is working as a manufacturing engineer on the project Meteor Missile, responsible for creating and updating plans and layouts from a design drawing, updating rework route cards, designing and ordering specialist tooling, overall ensuring that production of the missile is continuous.
       </p>
       <p>
        She has demonstrated an amazing desire and thirst for learning and knowledge about the company and the working-environment, with the capacity to absorb information quickly and use it effectively. She has been described by her employer as ‘without doubt a future leader in the business’.
       </p>
       <p>
        On accepting the award, Jade said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         As an apprentice I am able to earn whilst I learn, gaining degree level qualifications whilst gaining the practical experience at the same time. I believe in learning through experience and my apprenticeship allowed me.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         I’m very ambitious about my future. I started university in September, studying a B.Eng in Computer Aided Engineering. I cannot have enough passion and enthusiasm for apprenticeships. Without mine, I wouldn’t be the confident, mature, challenge-driven individual I am today: greatest decision of my life. Since starting my apprenticeship my confidence has increased significantly.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Nadhim Zahawi, the Prime Minister’s Apprenticeship Adviser, who presented the awards, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister is committed to 3 million apprenticeship starts by 2020 and I am excited to have a role in helping to deliver this goal, while pushing to revolutionise the skills of our workforce in Britain. Good quality apprenticeships create a fairer society by giving hard working young people the chance to aim for their dream job whilst playing their part in building a stronger economy for Britain.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         There are many examples of excellent apprenticeships and apprentices in England and these winners are the best of the best. I congratulate Jade on her success. It’s an honour to have been part of these awards; to play a small part in recognising the effort of so many great businesses and to reward apprentices for their hard work and dedication. All this year’s winners should shout from the rooftops about what taking an apprenticeship has done for them or what hiring an apprentice has done for their business. I am determined that apprenticeships should be given the recognition they deserve, because they absolutely do deserve it.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Beccy Pleasant, Head of Skills and Talent, Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         On behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Site Licence Companies I would like to congratulate the winner of the Higher Apprentice of the Year Category. There was an excellent calibre of nominations, illustrating the success of apprenticeships in creating the workforce of the future. The Nuclear Decommissioning Industry recognise that it is time to think differently about how we recruit and develop our future workforce.  Apprenticeships offer an excellent route for a range of different occupations. The application of learning to the workplace required by apprenticeships, means that the individuals can make valuable contributions early in their careers, and provides them options for different routes into employment.
