        In its 10th anniversary year, the week will give everyone involved in the apprenticeship community the perfect chance to celebrate individual stories of career progression over the last decade from traineeships through to higher and Degree apprenticeships
       </p>
       <p>
        During National Apprenticeship Week, employers and apprentices from across England will come together to demonstrate the many benefits that apprenticeships can bring. The week will also aim to encourage more employers to take on apprentices and individuals to choose an apprenticeship as a ladder of opportunity to a great career.
       </p>
       <p>
        A logo, incorporating the 10th anniversary of National Apprenticeship Week, has also been developed and is now available to promote and support the week. And, in addition to this,
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/toolkits-to-help-support-national-apprenticeship-week-2017">
         2 toolkits
        </a>
        have been created, to enable employers, apprentices, MPs, schools, colleges and training providers to start to plan how they will support the week. The toolkits include key messages, some suggestions for PR and social media and also some tips on hosting events.
       </p>

        Sue Husband, director of the National Apprenticeship Service said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         National Apprenticeship Week is a fantastic opportunity for us to celebrate the many benefits of apprenticeships. Year-on-year I am overwhelmed by how many organisations get behind the week and show their support with the huge amount of events and activities that take place across the country. I have no doubt that this, our 10th Anniversary, will be our biggest and best week yet.
        </p>
