     <p>
      In 2013 government introduced 24+ Advanced Learning Loans (loans) to remove upfront barriers to funding further education skills and training for people aged 24 and over.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the programme’s first year, thousands of learners have benefited from education and skills training as a result of accessing one of these loans. We want to continue to build upon this success by increasing the number of training providers eligible to deliver qualifications funded by a loan.
     </p>
     <p>
      This will allow even more learners to access high quality education and skills in their chosen subject area delivered flexibly to meet their needs and within their preferred locality. More information on the processes and timescales are outlined on the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/24-advanced-learning-loans-provider-expansion">

      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      These government backed loans are managed by the Skills Funding Agency and administered by the Student Loans Company.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        Prospective providers of 24 + Advanced Learning Loans must complete a procurement process through which they can demonstrate their financial health and capacity and capability to deliver education and skills funded by loans.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        The eligibility criteria for the approval of loans includes criteria for the individual, the qualification and the provider.
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      This opportunity is time limited so if you are interested in delivering loans-funded provision, please refer to the
