      The Olympic-style torch, engineered by apprentices, is touring Southern England in the run-up to National Apprenticeship Week.
     </p>
     <p>
      The torch, which symbolises the passing of knowledge from one generation to the next, will be making an appearance at business events during February and March, offering employers the opportunity to showcase their commitment to 3 million apprenticeships by 2020 by
      <a href="http://naw.pledgeometer.net/EventPage" rel="external">
       pledging
      </a>
      to recruit apprentices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The torch began its journey at the National Apprenticeship Awards in London on the 26th January 2016 and will also be making an appearance at the launch of National Apprenticeship Week in London on Monday 14th March.
     </p>
     <p>
      Director of the National Apprenticeship Service Sue Husband said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The Prime Minister is committed to 3 million apprenticeship starts by 2020. Good quality apprenticeships offer a fantastic way for many young people to earn as they learn whilst providing employers with the skills they need for their business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both employers and their apprentices have a great opportunity to step into the spotlight during National Apprenticeship Week, to help show how an apprenticeship really can take you anywhere. National Apprenticeship Week runs from 14 to 18 March and this year will celebrate how apprenticeships can help individuals and businesses achieve their ambition of ‘rising to the top’.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ‘pass the torch’ campaign and employer challenge will see an Olympic-style torch, engineered by apprentices, journey across Southern England in the run-up to and during National Apprenticeship Week. The torch showcases the extraordinary talent of apprentices and represents the transferring of knowledge from one individual to another. It is also being used to support the passing on of apprenticeship knowledge from employer to employer.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Our ambition is for the torch to encourage pledges from employers to take on apprentices - to see businesses thrive and to give young people the skills and jobs our economy needs.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
