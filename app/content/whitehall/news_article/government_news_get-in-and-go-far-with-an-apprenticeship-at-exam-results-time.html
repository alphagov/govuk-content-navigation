        With this being the first year that young people are required to stay in education or training until they turn 18, there’s never been a better time to consider an apprenticeship.
       </p>
       <p>
        Apprentices now have the opportunity to ‘get in and go far’ with an apprenticeship at some of Britain’s biggest and brightest companies, including Google, ASOS and ITV. With three levels of apprenticeships, intermediate, advanced and higher/degree, people with varying skills and qualifications can consider apprenticeships as a great option for a successful future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sue Husband, Director of the National Apprenticeship Service, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         This is an exciting time of year for young people, but it can also be worrying as they wait to hear what their future holds. We want young people to know that whatever their results, an apprenticeship can offer them a successful future. We want it to become the norm for young people to choose between an apprenticeship and university as equally prestigious routes to a great career and secure finances.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Apprenticeships have increased at a record rate. More than 850,000 people were earning and learning on an apprenticeship in the 2013/14 academic year. And it’s easy to see why. Apprenticeships enable young people and adults to earn while they learn in a real job, gaining a real qualification, up to degree level, and a real future. There’s never been a better time to become an apprentice.
        </p>
