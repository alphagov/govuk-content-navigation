      Ofsted today publishes the
      <a href="http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/local-authorities/doncaster" rel="external">
       outcome letter
      </a>
      of its inspection of Doncaster Council’s arrangements for supporting school improvement. This inspection is part of a programme by which Ofsted inspects the ways in which local authorities support and challenge all schools in their areas to get better.
     </p>
     <p>
      This inspection took place between 23 and 27 March 2015, when discussions were held with local authority officials, councillors, school leaders and others with an interest in education in the borough.
     </p>
     <p>
      Moreover, inspectors also scrutinised documents about the local authority’s arrangements for school improvement and some Ofsted inspection reports for schools in Doncaster. Inspectors also took account of the feedback of 8 inspections and from 12 school and academy leaders who were contacted in the week before the inspection.
