      Pupils from 2 Cumbria schools have marked the start of work on a modern, multi-million pound building through the government’s flagship rebuilding programme.
     </p>
     <p>
      Workington Academy is being built through the £4.4 billion
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/priority-school-building-programme-psbp">
       priority school building programme (
       <abbr title="priority school building programme">
        PSBP
       </abbr>
       )
      </a>
      , which is transforming some of the most run-down schools in the country.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a result of the £20.1 million investment, 2 schools - Stainburn School and Science College and Southfield Technology College - will come together in a modern, fit-for-purpose new 2-storey facility. Work is due to be completed by June 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister Lord Nash said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Our investment in school buildings across the country is transforming the learning environment for tens of thousands of pupils and their teachers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The start of construction at Workington Academy is a key milestone for the
       <abbr title="priority school building programme">
        PSBP
       </abbr>
       in Cumbria.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Ensuring all children have access to the best possible schools and facilities is just one part of our commitment to help all young people reach their potential regardless of their background. These buildings will provide modern, fit-for-purpose schools for pupils for many years to come.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Lorrayne Hughes, Executive Headteacher of William Howard Trust, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       These are really exciting times for the community of Workington, with a fantastic new building underway that will provide excellent facilities and an outstanding learning environment.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      A spokesman for Sir Robert McAlpine said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Sir Robert McAlpine are extremely excited about being involved in this prestigious project. We have a wealth of experience of designing and constructing schools all over the country which we will bring to Workington to provide the excellent facility which the town has long required.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       We are also confident that the construction phase itself will boost the local economy. For instance the work has already commenced using local contractors, we have placed future orders with other members of the local supply chain and additionally a number of our management staff live in the local area.
      </p>

      Thanks to the
      <abbr title="priority school building programme">
       PSBP
      </abbr>
      , school buildings are being rebuilt faster and cheaper than those built under the previous school building initiative - Building Schools for the Future (
      <abbr title="building schools for the future">
       BSF
      </abbr>
      ). Under the
      <abbr title="building schools for the future">
       BSF
      </abbr>
      it took 3 years for construction work to begin. This was slashed to 1 year for the
      <abbr title="priority school building programme">
       PSBP
      </abbr>
      , with projects costing around a third less.
     </p>
     <p>
      A total of 537 schools will benefit from construction through the 2 phases of the
