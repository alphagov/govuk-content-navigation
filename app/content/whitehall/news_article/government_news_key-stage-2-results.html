      Schools Minister Nick Gibb congratulates pupils on their work as results for provisional key stage 2 test results are published.
     </p>
     <p>
      The percentage of pupils achieving level 4 or above in both English and mathematics was 74 per cent. The percentage of pupils achieving the expected level or above in the combination of reading, writing and mathematics was 65 per cent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Every year pupils and teachers work hard to prepare for the key stage 2 tests. Today I’d like to congratulate everyone who took the tests this year for their effort and achievements. I’d like to thank the parents, teachers and schools who helped prepare pupils so well.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      He went on to underline the importance and value of proper externally marked tests and stressed the need for a greater focus and emphasis on the teaching of reading and maths in primary schools.
