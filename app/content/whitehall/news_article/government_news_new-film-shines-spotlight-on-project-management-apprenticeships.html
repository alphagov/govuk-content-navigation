      . It shows how apprentices are playing an active role in key project management duties including planning, allocating resources and tasks and completing documentation.

     <p>
      Due to the essential role project management plays in businesses large and small, the Project Management Higher Apprenticeship is suitable for employers in a wide range of industries, such as consultancy, logistics and manufacturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Karen Woodward, Deputy Director for Apprenticeships and Employer Policy Implementation at the Skills Funding Agency, said:
     </p>
     <p>
      “The Higher Apprenticeship in Project Management was introduced to give employers the opportunity to grow their own future project managers with the exact skills that their businesses need. Apprenticeships are delivering for businesses of all sizes and we hope this latest Sector in the Spotlight film will help convince even more employers to consider Apprenticeships, and also Traineeships which help unlock the great potential of young people.”

It incorporates a level 4 qualification, which is the equivalent to the first year of university. It covers many topics including managing risk, project communications, stakeholder management and dealing with contracts.
