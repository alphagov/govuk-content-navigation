        According to research conducted by ICM, the main driver behind this increase in job confidence is the economic recovery, with 57% claiming they are more job confident as a result of improving business outlook - an increase of 15 percentage points from 42% in August and November 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        The overall index is based on research looking at various issues affecting someone’s confidence in finding work, analyses the state of the nation’s work and employment prospects.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the regions and across all sectors of society, it appears that overall job confidence is increasing. The North East and West Midlands saw the biggest leaps in job confidence compared to 3 months ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, when it comes to pinning down job opportunities and performing under pressure, the index reveals that job seekers may need more help.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just over a quarter of people (28%) do not feel confident in being interviewed for a job, compared to 35% in November 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, despite a general consensus amongst those that are unemployed but seeking work, that developing a CV and gaining work experience are important steps in showing ability to future employers, the index showed only a third of all respondents have actually taken steps to update their CV and less than 1 in 10 (7%) have applied for work experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        Skills and Enterprise Minister Matthew Hancock said: “It is testament to our long term economic plan that people are becoming more confident in the jobs market. Every job means more economic security for families.
       </p>
       <p>
        “To support this growing feeling and as the recovery continues, people can be assured that the National Careers Service provides advice to all ages and at all stages of their working lives. I would urge anyone who needs help with their job search gets in touch with them today.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Key headlines from the index:
       </p>

        <li>
