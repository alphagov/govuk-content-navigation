        Schools Minister Nick Gibb congratulated young people receiving their
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
         A level
        </abbr>
        results today as new figures showed the number of students studying maths rose significantly - with entries up more than 20% in just 5 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was one of a number of academic subjects to see increases following the government’s drive to ensure more pupils studied them at both
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        and
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
         A level
        </abbr>
        through the introduction of the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-baccalaureate-ebacc">
         English Baccalaureate (
         <abbr title="English Baccalaureate">
          EBacc
         </abbr>
         ) performance measure
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall the number of entries in the facilitating subjects that are more often required by top universities than others are up by more than 15,000 since last year and 13.3% since 2010 - meaning more students are now studying the core academic subjects that will open doors to their future.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the same time, entries into non-facilitating subjects are down by almost 12% compared to 5 years ago with big falls in subjects like general studies, which are often not recognised by universities, with almost 30,000 fewer entries since 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         This year’s
         <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
          A level
         </abbr>
         students are among the best qualified in a generation and I want to congratulate them on today’s results which reflect the dedication of teachers and young people across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         These results provide the clearest proof that the introduction of the
         <abbr title="English Baccalaureate">
          EBacc
         </abbr>
         and our drive to persuade more pupils to study core academic subjects has been a success.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         As a result, thousands more pupils from all backgrounds are studying subjects that will secure them a place at a top university or an apprenticeship and that will help to secure well paid employment.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The growing rise in students taking facilitating subjects follows the introduction of the
        <abbr title="English Baccalaureate">
         EBacc
        </abbr>
        performance measure, which encourages the study of these subjects at
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Compared to 2014, today’s results show entries have risen in:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         further maths - up by 6.9%
        </li>
        <li>
         computing - up by 29.1%
        </li>
        <li>
         geography - up by 12.7%
        </li>
        <li>
         modern foreign languages - up by 3.8%
        </li>
        <li>
         English literature - up by 7.1%
        </li>
        <li>
         history - up by 7.1%
        </li>
        <li>
         maths - up by 4.4%
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The number of
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
         A level
        </abbr>
        entries in science and maths subjects has increased by more than 38,000 since 2010, up by 17.3%.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 2010, the government’s plan for education has included a focus on encouraging more young people, especially women, to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics (
        <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">
         STEM
        </abbr>
        ) subjects. This has resulted in 16,000 more

        </abbr>
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
         A level
        </abbr>
        entries for women.
       </p>
       <p>
        The number of entries in facilitating subjects by women has also increased by around 27,000 since 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were more than 850,000
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
         A level
        </abbr>
        entries in 2015, and Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) figures show the proportion of pass rates has risen by 0.1 percentage points this year to 98.1%.
