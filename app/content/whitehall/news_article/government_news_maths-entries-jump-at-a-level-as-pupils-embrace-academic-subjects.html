      Schools Minister Nick Gibb congratulated young people receiving their
      <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
       A level
      </abbr>
      results today as new figures showed the number of students studying maths rose significantly - with entries up more than 20% in just 5 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was one of a number of academic subjects to see increases following the government’s drive to ensure more pupils studied them at both
      <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
       GCSE
      </abbr>
      and
      <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
       A level
      </abbr>
      through the introduction of the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-baccalaureate-ebacc">
       English Baccalaureate (
       <abbr title="English Baccalaureate">
        EBacc
       </abbr>
       ) performance measure
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall the number of entries in the facilitating subjects that are more often required by top universities than others are up by more than 15,000 since last year and 13.3% since 2010 - meaning more students are now studying the core academic subjects that will open doors to their future.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the same time, entries into non-facilitating subjects are down by almost 12% compared to 5 years ago with big falls in subjects like general studies, which are often not recognised by universities, with almost 30,000 fewer entries since 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       This year’s
       <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
        A level
       </abbr>
       students are among the best qualified in a generation and I want to congratulate them on today’s results which reflect the dedication of teachers and young people across the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       These results provide the clearest proof that the introduction of the
       <abbr title="English Baccalaureate">
        EBacc
       </abbr>
       and our drive to persuade more pupils to study core academic subjects has been a success.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       As a result, thousands more pupils from all backgrounds are studying subjects that will secure them a place at a top university or an apprenticeship and that will help to secure well paid employment.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The growing rise in students taking facilitating subjects follows the introduction of the
      <abbr title="English Baccalaureate">
       EBacc
      </abbr>
      performance measure, which encourages the study of these subjects at
      <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
       GCSE
      </abbr>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Compared to 2014, today’s results show entries have risen in:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       further maths - up by 6.9%
      </li>
      <li>
       computing - up by 29.1%
      </li>
      <li>
       geography - up by 12.7%
      </li>
      <li>
       modern foreign languages - up by 3.8%
      </li>
      <li>
       English literature - up by 7.1%
      </li>
      <li>
       history - up by 7.1%
      </li>
      <li>
       maths - up by 4.4%
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The number of
      <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
       A level
      </abbr>
      entries in science and maths subjects has increased by more than 38,000 since 2010, up by 17.3%.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since 2010, the government’s plan for education has included a focus on encouraging more young people, especially women, to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics (
      <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">
       STEM
      </abbr>
      ) subjects. This has resulted in 16,000 more
      <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">
       STEM
      </abbr>
      <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
       A level
      </abbr>
      entries for women.
     </p>
     <p>
      The number of entries in facilitating subjects by women has also increased by around 27,000 since 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      There were more than 850,000
      <abbr title="General Certificate of Education Advanced Level">
       A level
      </abbr>
      entries in 2015, and Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) figures show the proportion of pass rates has risen by 0.1 percentage points this year to 98.1%.
