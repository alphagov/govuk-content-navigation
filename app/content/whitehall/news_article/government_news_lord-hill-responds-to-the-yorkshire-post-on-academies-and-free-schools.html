       <p>
        What a shame that the hostility Chris Keates obviously feels towards academies and free schools (Yorkshire Post, 25 November 2010) blinds her to the facts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The truth is that academies, introduced by the last government, have raised educational standards: GCSE results have improved twice as fast in academies as the national average and in some academies much faster than that.
       </p>
       <p>
        International evidence shows that free schools also raise standards in schools. So in Bradford, the passion and determination of inspirational teachers to make a real difference with new free schools should be celebrated, not attacked.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contrary to what Ms Keates says, free schools will not be established without rigorous checks and independent schools that become free schools will have to stop charging fees.
       </p>
       <p>
        The schools white paper sets out our plans to raise standards and start to close the gap between rich and poor. Itâ€™s shocking that the latest figures show that only 40 of the 80,000 children in England eligible for free school meals secured places at Oxford or Cambridge.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the children from the poorest backgrounds who have been let down the most so, yes, we want to move fast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fortunately, passionate teachers, parents and charities are working flat out to create more great schools and give pupils more choice. It is they, not Ms Keates, who are leading the way.
