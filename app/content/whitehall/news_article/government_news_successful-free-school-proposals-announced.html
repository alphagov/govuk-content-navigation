      Eight mainstream schools, a sixth form and an alternative provision school join the 174 schools already open, and the 115 already in the free schools programme pipeline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once full, all open and approved free schools will provide 150,000 extra school places, with this latest wave providing a boost of about 5,000 places. All of the mainstream schools announced today are in areas facing a shortage of school places. Forty-five per cent will be in the 30% most deprived communities in Britain.
     </p>
     <p>
      The schools have been set up by a range of passionate and talented groups, with 1 common aim - to improve state education provision and choice for parents. Four of the proposals are from parent and community groups, including the Ealing Fields Free School in West London. Seven proposals are from teachers and existing schools, including 2 from the successful Harris Federation. The Eddie Davies Educational Trust in Bolton has been supported by Phil Gartside, chairman of Bolton Wanderers Football Club.
     </p>
     <p>
      Due to the popularity of free schools, the Department for Education has changed the application process to allow parents and other groups 3 opportunities per year to submit proposals compared to just 1 previously. Not only does this provide flexibility to proposers to submit their application at the time that suits them best, it also means the government can consider applications throughout the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Secretary Michael Gove said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I am delighted with the quality of the proposals we have received. Free schools are driving up education standards across England. They are hugely popular with parents, providing more choice and freedom and, crucially, they are benefiting children from all backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       With almost three-quarters of those inspected so far rated good or outstanding, they are a significant boost to communities poorly served for generations.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Like academies, free schools have greater freedom than local-authority-run schools, giving headteachers more power to make decisions that are right for local children. It has allowed schools like the Brighton Bilingual School, with its dual Anglo-Spanish curriculum, and the Free School Norwich, which opens from 8am to 6pm, 51 weeks a year, to open.
     </p>
     <p>
      The government also today announced the approval of 6 university technical college (
      <abbr title="university technical colleges">
       UTC
      </abbr>
      ) and 5 studio school proposals backed by major employers and industrial partners including Network Rail, the National Space Centre and the James Dyson Foundation. There are now 50

      and studio schools will provide more than 45,000 extra places for young people.

     </h2>
     <ol>
      <li>
       There are currently 174 open free schools, 17 open university technical colleges and 28 open studio schools.
      </li>
      <li>
       The free schools groups approved today will now finalise their plans in readiness to open from September 2015, apart from the Eddie Davies Educational Trust School, which aims to open in September 2014. Chief among their tasks will be to secure a site. The department has co-developed a
       <a href="http://www.gov.uk/find-government-property">
        website with the Cabinet Office
       </a>
       that lists all surplus government property available to buy or rent, including those suitable for free schools. Preparations also include undertaking a statutory consultation in their local area and taking steps to recruit their school’s principal designate.

      <li>
       <abbr title="university technical colleges">
        UTCs
       </abbr>
       are academies for 14- to 19-year-olds which focus on delivering technical education that engages young people and meets the needs of modern business. They offer full-time courses which combine practical and academic studies. Students benefit from a curriculum designed by experts in the field and are then supported to learn through work placements and access to industry standard facilities and equipment. They typically cater for around 500 to 800 students.
      </li>
      <li>
       Studio schools are innovative all-ability academies for 14- to 19-year-olds which offer a practical learning experience.  They combine academic study (with a core of maths, English and science plus other subjects) with cross-curricular learning tackling real-life problems and projects. Local employers are involved in the design and delivery of studio schools’ curricula, and all students undertake work experience.

       <abbr title="university technical colleges">

       and studio schools have the same freedoms as free schools and academies. This allows them to be innovative in, for instance, how they may choose to employ engineers with an industry background alongside qualified teachers; how they develop and deliver innovative projects for pupils; and how they extend the school year and day to prepare students for the world of work. The studio schools approved today will all open in 2015, and the
       <abbr title="university technical colleges">
