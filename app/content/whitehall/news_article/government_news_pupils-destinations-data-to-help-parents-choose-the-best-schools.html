      Parents and students can now see for themselves how successful their schools and colleges are at ensuring young people fulfil their potential, including how many progress on to top universities, thanks to new government data published today.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/destinations-of-key-stage-4-and-key-stage-5-pupils-2011-to-2012">
       destinations data
      </a>
      is published so parents and students can make informed judgements about the performance of schools and colleges in their areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today’s figures reveal what young people went on to do after leaving school or college in 2011. The data captures how many go on to attend university, begin apprenticeships or training, or embark on a career.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister David Laws said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       We are publishing this data so people can see for themselves how different schools, colleges and local authorities perform. It is right that parents have as much information as possible on which to base decisions for their children’s education.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some students will be aiming to get a job after college, others will be hoping to win a place at a great university. But all schools and colleges must ensure they deliver for all their students - whatever that student’s target.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many schools are excelling at this, including Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney - one of the most deprived parts of the country. Today’s figures show Mossbourne sent 7% of its pupils to Oxbridge in 2011 to 2012, making it one of the top state performers.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       And Birkenhead High School Academy, an all-girls school in the Wirral, Merseyside, sent 38% of its students to Russell Group universities - way above the national average of 11% for state schools.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The government has a package of measures to help young people get the best possible start in life. This includes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       introducing free schools and academies into some of the most deprived parts of the country, such as the London Academy of Excellence, a free school in Stratford, East London, where 6 students have been offered places at Oxbridge this year alone, and Derby Pride Academy, an alternative provision free school rated ‘outstanding’ earlier this year that is transforming the lives of many at risk of dropping off from education
      </li>
      <li>
       introducing the pupil premium - extra funding given to schools for every disadvantaged pupil they teach. For 2014 to 2015 it is worth £2.5 billion, up from £625 million in 2011 to 2012. This now equates to £1,300 per disadvantaged primary pupil and £935 per disadvantaged secondary pupil
      </li>
      <li>
       introducing a rigorous new curriculum and world-class qualifications, ensuring proper preparation for further and higher education, and work
      </li>
      <li>
       ensuring that young people who have not achieved at least a C in
       <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
        GCSE
       </abbr>
       English or maths must continue studying those subjects up to the age of 18
      </li>
      <li>
       removing low-quality vocational qualifications from league tables in favour of courses proven to deliver the skills employers demand
      </li>
      <li>
       a £30 million package of funding designed to improve the prospects of up to 20,000 vulnerable young people, helping to prevent them becoming
       <abbr title="not in education, employment, or training">
        NEET
       </abbr>
      </li>
      <li>
       a new programme of traineeships to help those aged 16 to 23 (inclusive) to develop the skills and vital experience they need to secure apprenticeships and other sustainable jobs
      </li>
      <li>
       spending £7.2 billion in 2014 to 2015 to fund a place in education or training for every 16- or 17-year-old who wants one
      </li>
      <li>
       encouraging schools and colleges to use employers to mentor and inspire young people towards ambitious careers, as part of revamped careers guidance
      </li>
      <li>
       raising the participation age so that young people in England are now required to continue in education or training beyond the age of 16
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Alongside the destinations of those leaving mainstream state education, today’s figures are the first to measure the destinations of students from independent schools, special schools and pupil referral units or other alternative provision. This reinforces the importance of ensuring all providers are held to account for helping their pupils fulfil their potential.
