        The focused inspections are part of a concerted programme of action by Ofsted to establish why children in some parts of the country have a much lower chance of attending a good or better school than their peers in other similar areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ten schools were inspected during the focused inspection week including: one nursery school; five primary schools; two junior schools; one secondary school; and one special school. The schools were randomly selected for this exercise from those due for inspection by the end of this academic year.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the inspections Her Majesty’s Inspectors also gathered information on the use, quality and impact of local authority support for school improvement by asking three additional key questions of headteachers and governors.

         The letter to Derby City has been published online.

        <li>
         Ofsted announced the first wave of focused school inspections across local authority areas, where children are being denied the standard of education they deserve, on 17 January 2013. The press release is available in the Ofsted website.
        </li>
        <li>
         Local authority areas are being selected for the focused school inspection programme taking place during the spring 2013 term on the basis of the relative proportion of children attending good or better primary schools, as set out in the last Ofsted Annual Report, and Ofsted data on the proportion of children attending good or better secondary schools, as well as any relevant inspection evidence gathered during the autumn 2012 term. These standard section 5 inspections, which were scheduled to take place this academic year but are being brought forward, will include all types of schools - although the majority will be primary schools.
        </li>
        <li>
         The data published at the time of the Ofsted Annual Report showed that in Derby, 43% of children are in primary schools rated good or outstanding and 42% of children are in secondary schools rated good or better.
        </li>
        <li>
         Ofsted is currently consulting on the new inspection framework for local authority school improvement functions, which will be piloted from April 2013 and planned for full implementation from June 2013.
