        The Department for Education today published a film detailing the key education reforms over the last 4 years that are transforming the schools landscape in England.
       </p>
       <p>
        The film - titled ‘The school revolution’ - features comment by headteachers, teachers, governors and educationalists who have played leading roles in ushering in the reforms or who have been on the frontline and witnessed first-hand the benefits they have already had.
       </p>
       <p>
        They include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Liam Nolan and Jacqui Powell, from the Perry Beeches Academy Trust in Birmingham
        </li>

         Amanda Spielman, of Ofqual, discussing the reforms to the qualifications system
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The participants tell how great heads and teachers now have more freedom to innovate, spread their excellence and use their energy, talent and skills in different ways, including through the accelerated academies programme and through free schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        It outlines how the school structure is now underpinned by self-improvement and collaboration, where professionals helping, supporting and training each other, including through schemes like School Direct, whereby schools can now train their own recruits, and

        </abbr>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        And there is also comment on how the expensive and time-consuming Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme has been replaced by a far more cost-effective and quicker approach to new or refurbished school projects.

        Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

         This film demonstrates the breadth and variety of the improvements in England’s schools today.

        <p class="last-child">
         But what started four years ago is only the beginning - the professionals, parents and pupils in the film are just some of the thousands of people who can see the progress already made and want to see this momentum maintained.

         It would seem that what we have created here in Birmingham is enormously popular with parents. Parents want a structured, organised, disciplined education for their children. It is happening in the very best independent and the very best grammar schools. Why shouldn’t it be open to children from normal comprehensive schools? They should have the same structure and rigour and standards. Perry Beeches I has 180 places in year 7 with 1,010 applicants. Perry Beeches II has 100 places in next year’s Year 7 with 450 applicants.

         Absolutely key to free schools is that parents in their local community want them. They have to have a really clear vision, what they want to do, why it’s going to be better than the other options.

         I’m under no constraints here and that’s probably by virtue of the fact that my head is under fewer constraints when it comes to the curriculum and the way we teach things, the way we organise our classrooms and the school day. That’s given me the chance to throw out the old maths curriculum and start with something completely from scratch. That’s being rolled out across the country under the maths mastery banner.

         You have to be realistic about the labour market - young people have to go on doing English and maths. If you don’t have decent English and maths, they won’t give you a job - stop pretending things are different and put it into the programme. It’s really important to get employers involved in assessment and designing qualifications, but at local level.

         It was ferociously fast and a very challenging budget particularly when compared to the work that all of us had been doing in the previous 5 years where for a new secondary school it wasn’t unusual to have a budget of £20 million to £25 million. This project had a budget of approximately £4.8 million, and from the appointment of the team to the opening of the doors took just over 12 months.

         We’ve opened in an industry building left empty for two-and-a-half years and we have refurbished it. Where BSF was spending £25 million to £30 million in this area on schools not too far away, we have spent £5 million on buying and refurbishing it and getting it ready to be a school.
