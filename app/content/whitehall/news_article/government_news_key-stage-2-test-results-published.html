      National, regional and local authority figures for key stage 2 tests in reading, writing and maths at the end of primary school were published today (20 September 2012).
     </p>
     <p>
      This is an interim year for key stage 2 tests following recommendations made by the Bew Review into testing, assessment and accountability. For writing, there was no externally marked key stage 2 test. The subject’s score was solely based on teacher assessment of a pupil’s writing. This means that direct comparisons with previous years’ scores are not possible.

     <blockquote>

       I congratulate pupils, teachers and families on their hard work and achievements. The Government is committed to driving up standards by giving teachers more freedom, strengthening discipline and improving teacher quality.
