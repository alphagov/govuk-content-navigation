      A further £5 million has been awarded to the Education and Training Foundation (
      <abbr title="Education and Training Foundation">
       ETF
      </abbr>
      ) to continue their work to ensure further and technical education is of the highest quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      This money will allow
      <abbr title="Education and Training Foundation">
       ETF
      </abbr>
      to continue to support colleges in delivering the recommendations set out by the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/post-16-education-and-training-area-reviews">
       area review programme
      </a>
      . Recommendations include mergers between colleges and conversion to academies, which will raise standards and benefit learners and employers in each area. Additionally, it will also continue support all further education providers to expand apprenticeships and prepare for the introduction of new technical routes.
     </p>
     <p>
      This comes on top of the £24 million that has already been awarded to the foundation this year to support their work to improve the standards of teaching and learning in the further education sector and benefit learners.

     <p>
      Apprenticeships and Skills Minister Robert Halfon said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Further education is playing a vital role in driving social justice and making Britain the skills nation that we need it to be.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       This £5 million we are awarding the Education and Training Foundation will help to ensure high-quality technical routes, support area reviews and prepare the sector and its leaders for the exciting and important changes coming out of the skills plan.
