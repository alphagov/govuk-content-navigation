      We are keen to receive your feedback and views on how we have been performing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over the last 12 months we have worked very closely with the further education (FE) sector to improve the way we fund FE and skills training in England.
     </p>
     <p>
      We have continued to simplify the funding system, introduced a streamlined performance management process in the funding year 2013 to 2014 and we continue to work with the FE sector to deliver more high-quality Apprenticeships and Traineeship opportunities, so learners can access the right level of skills that employers need to help the economy grow.
     </p>
     <p>
      Moving forward to the next 12 months, it is important for us to recognise any areas of improvement in the way we operate and communicate and would welcome you taking a few minutes of your time to complete the
      <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TGBZKJG" rel="external">
       survey
      </a>
      , which is open until Friday, 25 July.
