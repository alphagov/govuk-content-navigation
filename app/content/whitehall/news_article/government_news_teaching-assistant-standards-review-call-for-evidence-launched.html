      Teaching professionals, unions, parents and others are from today (28 October 2014) being invited to give their views as part of a nationwide review to create a new set of professional standards for teaching assistants.
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/review-of-standards-for-teaching-assistants-launched">
       Earlier this month a review was launched
      </a>
      aimed at replacing the current set of teaching assistant standards with a clearer and more concise version, reflecting the diversity of the existing schools system.
     </p>
     <p>
      The review, chaired by Kate Dethridge, Principal of Churchend Primary Academy, Reading, will be supported by a panel of experts with a diverse range of expertise.
To help the panel develop the new standards, a
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/developing-a-new-set-of-standards-for-teaching-assistants">
       call for evidence
      </a>
      has been launched today inviting headteachers, school governors, teachers, teaching assistants, union representatives, local authorities, parents and other interested parties to submit their views.
     </p>
     <p>
      Responses will be accepted until November 21 and can be completed online.
     </p>
     <p>
      The review is expected to report back to the Secretary of State for Education in spring 2015.
