        The 15 apprentices, employed by UK Power Networks, are the first to successfully complete one of the new Trailblazer apprenticeships, designed by top employers to meet the needs of industry. The Trailblazer programme forms a key part of the government’s reform of apprenticeships to ensure businesses get the skills they need to succeed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The apprentices will now put their 18-month Power Network Craftsperson Standard training programme to good use, working as ‘jointers’, connecting and repairing underground electricity cables across London, the South East and East Anglia. Their role will also include working with top energy suppliers to install smart meters in 8.1 million homes across London, the South East and East Anglia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the success of the apprenticeship standard, it was also announced at today’s event that employers in the sector have committed to recruiting over 4000 apprentices this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nadhim Zahawi, Apprenticeship Adviser for the Prime Minister, hosted the event and said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         It is tremendously exciting for me to host this ground-breaking event, to celebrate the first apprentice graduates on a new Standard.
        </p>
        <p>
         Trailblazers have a massive bearing on the future of apprenticeships, setting out the exact skills, attributes and talents that employers need as well as stamping the mark of quality indelibly on each apprenticeship.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         I can’t congratulate these 15 apprentices enough for their dedication to their profession and succeeding in achieving their apprenticeships.
        </p>
       </blockquote>

        Mick Shannon, 55, of Grays, Essex, joined UK Power Networks’ trainee scheme in 2014. He said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         I am honoured to have completed my apprenticeship alongside my son Lee and I speak on behalf of the whole team when I say that this apprenticeship has been of huge benefit to us all as we deliver in our jobs, giving us all role specific skills and a nationally recognised qualification.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Today’s event reinforces the government’s commitment to 3 million apprenticeships by 2020, providing the skills employers and the economy need for growth. Apprenticeships are available in 1,500 job roles, in more than 170 industries. Apprenticeships develop a motivated, skilled and qualified workforce and improve productivity.
