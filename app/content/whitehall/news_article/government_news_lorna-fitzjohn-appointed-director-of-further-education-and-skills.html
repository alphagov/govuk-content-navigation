      Lorna has a strong track record in the sector. Before joining Ofsted in 2007, Lorna worked in the delivery, management and quality assurance of vocational, employment skills training and education in the post-16 sector. She has held senior management positions within primary and post-16 education, including large FE colleges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commenting on her appointment, Lorna said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       I am delighted to take up the role of Director for Further Education and Skills at Ofsted and will be looking to build on the work of my predecessor, Matthew Coffey HMI, in improving standards and outcomes for learners.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Further education is a vital sector which provides learners of all ages with the skills and opportunities they need to succeed. We are seeing teachers and providers make significant improvements, helping learners to get the qualifications they need to find employment in the industries they want.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       However, there is still much to be done to ensure that all FE providers offer a quality learning experience. There are big changes planned for the way Ofsted inspect schools and I will be working closely with the FE sector to consider ways in which we can bring these changes into the inspection of apprenticeships, colleges and more in order to improve standards and outcomes.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      As well as taking on her role as Director for FE and Skills, Lorna will continue as Regional Director for the West Midlands, which she has held since January 2013. Her predecessor, Matthew Coffey HMI, will become Chief Operating Officer at Ofsted.
