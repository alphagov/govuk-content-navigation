      Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has championed the well-judged use of technology in education as she opened a major conference.
     </p>
     <p>
      Speaking at the BETT technology show, the Education Secretary said the government recognised the importance of education technology, for example in easing teacher workloads and giving young pupils the digital skills they need for the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      She said education technology had an important role to play in supporting great teachers and a rigorous curriculum.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I am extremely excited about the possibilities technology is opening up in education, and during my visits to the stalls at BETT I saw some truly amazing innovations.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is undoubtedly a place for technology in helping to raise standards, whether it is helping teachers plan lessons or allowing schools to better measure pupil progress.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       The best technology plays an important role in helping great teachers deliver a rigorous, knowledge-based curriculum.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Other key points outlined in the speech included:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the announcement of plans to begin prototyping new systems for data collection - making it easier for schools to share data with the department
      </li>
      <li>
       the role of our world-class computing curriculum in giving the next generation the skills they need to compete in the future job market and to help shape the world of the future
      </li>
      <li>
       the impact of online and computerised assessments in helping to ease the workload of hard-working teachers
      </li>
     </ul>
