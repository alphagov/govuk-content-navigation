        The proportion of young people in education or training rose across England last year, according to
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/participation-in-education-and-training-by-local-authority">
         figures published today
        </a>
        (9 March 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Data collected by local authorities shows that at the end of 2015 91.2% of 16- and 17-year-olds were in some form of education or training. This was a 1 percentage point rise on the same period in 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of its commitment to delivering educational excellence everywhere, the government is determined to ensure all young people, irrespective of their background, have the chance to fulfil their potential.
       </p>
       <p>
        Skills Minister Nick Boles said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         The rise in 16-and 17-year-olds participating in education or training is very welcome, and we will work with councils to ensure this positive trend continues.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The figures also show the proportion of 16-and 17-year-olds on council databases whose activity was not known fell from 4.8% to 4.3%.
       </p>
       <p>
        94.9% of 16-year-olds were in some form of education and training, 0.7 percentage points more than in December 2014.  87.5% of 17-year-olds were in education and training, 1.2 percentage points more than in December 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has undertaken a number of reforms since 2010 to help young people over the age of 16 fulfil their potential, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         raising the age of compulsory participation in some form of education or training to 18
        </li>
        <li>
         stripping out low-quality technical and professional qualifications which were not valued by employers from league tables
        </li>
        <li>
         putting in place plans to simplify the technical and professional education system by introducing high-quality, easy-to-understand routes leading to skilled employment, which will be as easy to understand as academic routes
        </li>
       </ul>
