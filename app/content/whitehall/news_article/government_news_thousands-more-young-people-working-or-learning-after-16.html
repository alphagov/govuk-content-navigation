      Thousands more young people are continuing on to study or work after the age of 16,
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/provisional-destinations-key-stage-4-and-5-pupils-2013-to-2014">
       official figures
      </a>
      reveal today (Tuesday 20 October).
     </p>
     <p>
      The figures show a rise in positive outcomes for students after both
      <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
       GCSE
      </abbr>
      and A level stages of education (key stages 4 and 5) - demonstrating the positive impact of the government’s plan to equip all young people with the skills they need to unlock their potential.
     </p>
     <p>
      Between 2012 to 2013 and 2013 to 2014, the proportion of students going into education, training or employment after A level or similar qualifications rose by 2 percentage points - the equivalent of around 18,000 people.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proportion going to the top third of universities rose by a percentage point - the equivalent of almost 8,500 people.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Ensuring all young people have the knowledge and skills they need to unlock their potential is a key part of this government’s commitment to social justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is therefore extremely encouraging to see a growing number of young people are either continuing to study, or going into training or employment after
       <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
        GCSEs
       </abbr>
       .
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Destination measures help to hold schools and colleges to account, and ensure that in future even more young people are either studying or training from the age of 16.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Destination measures are increasingly being seen as key to assessing how well schools and colleges prepare their students to make a successful transition into the next stage of education or training, or employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest key stage 4 and 5 destination data shows:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the proportion of students in continuous education, employment or training 6 months after completing key stage 5 (A level) rose from 71% in 2012 to 2013 to 73% in 2013 to 2014 - equivalent to around 18,000 young people
      </li>
      <li>
       the proportion of students in continuous education, employment or training 6 months after completing key stage 4 (
       <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
        GCSE
       </abbr>
       ) rose from 91% in 2012 to 2013 to 92% in 2013 to 2014 - equivalent to 15,500
