        Thousands more young people are continuing on to study or work after the age of 16,
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/provisional-destinations-key-stage-4-and-5-pupils-2013-to-2014">
         official figures
        </a>
        reveal today (Tuesday 20 October).
       </p>
       <p>
        The figures show a rise in positive outcomes for students after both
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        and A level stages of education (key stages 4 and 5) - demonstrating the positive impact of the government’s plan to equip all young people with the skills they need to unlock their potential.
       </p>
       <p>
        Between 2012 to 2013 and 2013 to 2014, the proportion of students going into education, training or employment after A level or similar qualifications rose by 2 percentage points - the equivalent of around 18,000 people.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proportion going to the top third of universities rose by a percentage point - the equivalent of almost 8,500 people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Ensuring all young people have the knowledge and skills they need to unlock their potential is a key part of this government’s commitment to social justice.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is therefore extremely encouraging to see a growing number of young people are either continuing to study, or going into training or employment after
         <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
          GCSEs
         </abbr>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Destination measures help to hold schools and colleges to account, and ensure that in future even more young people are either studying or training from the age of 16.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Destination measures are increasingly being seen as key to assessing how well schools and colleges prepare their students to make a successful transition into the next stage of education or training, or employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The latest key stage 4 and 5 destination data shows:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the proportion of students in continuous education, employment or training 6 months after completing key stage 5 (A level) rose from 71% in 2012 to 2013 to 73% in 2013 to 2014 - equivalent to around 18,000 young people
        </li>
        <li>
         the proportion of students in continuous education, employment or training 6 months after completing key stage 4 (
         <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
          GCSE
         </abbr>
         ) rose from 91% in 2012 to 2013 to 92% in 2013 to 2014 - equivalent to 15,500
