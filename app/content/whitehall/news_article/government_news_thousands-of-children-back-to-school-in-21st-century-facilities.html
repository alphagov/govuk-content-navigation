      Thousands of children returning to school this autumn term will walk through the doors of brand new state-of-the-art buildings, thanks to a government initiative to refurbish and rebuild some of the worst school buildings in the country.
     </p>
     <p>
      Across the country, 28 schools will be opening the door to new, modern buildings thanks to the government’s £4.4 billion priority school building programme (
      <abbr title="priority school building programme">
       PSBP
      </abbr>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      Lord Nash, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the School System, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       We are raising standards in our schools, with more than 1.4 million more pupils in good or outstanding schools than in 2010, and it is only right that children are learning in an environment that matches the standard of that education.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       The priority school building programme is transforming hundreds of school buildings on budget and ahead of schedule ensuring that all children, regardless of background, can learn in an environment that will help them fulfil their potential.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The
      <abbr title="priority school building programme">
       PSBP
      </abbr>
      is transforming the most run-down schools in the country by providing facilities fit for the 21st century, including bright classrooms, inspiring libraries and specialist music facilities. The new buildings will ensure pupils have the right environment to help them fulfil their potential.
     </p>
     <p>
      South Nottinghamshire Academy is one of those to reopen through the programme following a £12 million rebuild. The academy will open its doors to a brand-new 3-storey building with purpose-built science and technology areas and improved library and
      <abbr title="information technology">
       IT
      </abbr>
      facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lansdowne School, a special school in south London, has been equipped with state-of-the-art facilities to teach pupils with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), thanks to £7.7 million funding through the programme. The new building includes an open dining area and a modern learning resource centre, as well as space for the school to introduce new post-16 provision.
     </p>
     <p>
      More than 140 schools have opened through the initiative and the majority of the 260 schools in the first phase of the programme will open new or refurbished buildings by the end of 2017, 2 years earlier than originally planned.
     </p>
     <p>
      A total of 537 schools will benefit from construction through the 2 phases of the
      <abbr title="priority school building programme">
       PSBP

      .
