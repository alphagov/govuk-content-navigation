        Education Secretary Michael Gove said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         I am pleased to announce these appointments to the School Teachers’ Review Body. I hope they will make a valuable contribution to the work of the STRB.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Dame Patricia Hodgson, Chair of the STRB, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         I am delighted to welcome Peter, Debbie and Jonathan to the Review Body. Together, they bring a wide breadth of knowledge and experience that will assist the Review Body in its important work considering teachers’ pay and conditions.

          The appointment process was run in accordance with the code of practice issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) and was made on merit: political activity played no part in the selection process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations and the code of practice, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared), and other information, to be made public.

          The School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) considers aspects of teachers’ pay and conditions for just under half a million teachers and school leaders in England and Wales. Its work has a direct impact on teachers and head teachers and through them on the education of children. The STRB was established under the terms of the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Act 1991 (as replaced by the Education Act 2002). It is a statutory independent advisory body. Its function is to consider matters referred to it by the Secretary of State for Education in relation to the remuneration, professional duties or working time of school teachers and to report to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State.
