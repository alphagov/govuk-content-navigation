     <p>
      The Department for Education today published new data showing how many students progressed to further or higher education or training for each school, college and local authority in England.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is also the first time that the number and proportion of young people in a school, college and authority who attend Oxbridge or another Russell Group university is being published.
     </p>
     <p>
      The statistics - published as part of the Government’s transparency agenda - give parents and the public even greater information with which they can choose the right school or college for their child.
     </p>
     <p>
      In particular, today’s statistics, which relate to maintained schools, further education colleges and sixth form colleges, show what proportion and number of students were in:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       “sustained” education in the academic year 2009 to 2010, ie for at least six months, at both age 16 and after they take A level or equivalent qualifications
      </li>
      <li>
       at any higher education institution, any Russell Group university or just Oxbridge in 2009 and 2010.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      It is the latest step in the Department for Education’s pledge to open up a mass of previously unpublished statistics.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister Lord Hill said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       We are opening up access to this new data so people can see how different schools and colleges, and local authorities, perform. It gives parents greater information on which to base decisions.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      He added:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       It is interesting to see how well some local authorities in more deprived areas, and some schools and colleges in those authorities, do in terms of students going to our best universities, compared to those in other parts of the country.
      </p>

       <p>
        This is the first publication on “education destination measures” and is classified as experimental statistics as the data are still being evaluated and remain subject to further testing in terms of their reliability and ability to meet customer needs.
       </p>
      </li>

       <p>
        This SFR reports on young people in key stage 4 (KS4) and key stage 5 (KS5) in the 2008 to 2009 academic year and identifies their education destinations in the 2009 and 2010 academic year.

      Key stage 4
     </h3>
     <p>
      The 2008 to 2009 academic year cohort is obtained from the published performance tables (PT) where:
     </p>
     <p>
      Young people are identified as being at the end of KS4.  In the majority of schools, pupils in Year 11 in the academic year 2008 to 2009 school year were at the end of KS4, but some may have completed this key stage in an earlier or later year group.
     </p>
     <p>
      The base cohort includes students in English maintained mainstream schools only.
     </p>
     <h3 id="key-stage-5">
      Key stage 5
     </h3>
     <p>
      The 2008 to 2009 academic year cohort is obtained from the published performance tables where:
     </p>
     <p>
      Young people aged 16, 17 or 18, were entered for A levels or other level 3 equivalent qualifications during the 2008 to 2009 academic year; this is otherwise referred to as ‘Key Stage 5’.
     </p>
     <p>
      The qualifications included in the tables are on the basis of their equivalence with A levels; A qualification’s ‘equivalence’ is quantified by looking at its size and the level of challenge it poses compared to an A level. An ‘AS’ is a level 3 qualification but students only get included in the cohort if they have undertaken a qualification equivalent to the size of an A-level.
     </p>
     <p>
      The destination measures KS5 cohort is for maintained mainstream schools plus the addition of Further Education Colleges and Sixth Form Colleges.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        Creation of the Destination Measures requires higher education (HESA) data to be matched to the pupil data in the National Pupil Database. The HESA data used in this Release are for the academic year 2009 to 2010 and these are the most recent data to have been matched. This publication is therefore reporting on 2008 to 2009 KS4 and KS5 (A level or equivalent qualification/s) students who went on to education destinations in the academic year 2009 to 2010.
