      The Department for Education today published the progress report of the independent review into Key Stage 2 testing, assessment and accountability.
     </p>
     <p>
      The report summarises the evidence submitted to a small review panel during a 12-week call for evidence. The review is chaired by the cross-bench peer Lord Bew.
     </p>
     <p>
      The panel received nearly 4,000 online responses and about 100 written submissions, and took evidence directly from around 50 stakeholders. Its recommendations for testing and assessment at the end of primary school will be in a final report this summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Secretary Michael Gove ordered the review to see how the current system of Key Stage 2 testing, assessment and accountability can be improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Michael Gove said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       I have asked Lord Bew to review how the testing, assessment and accountability system can be improved, particularly in light of the concerns of head teachers and teachers. I am grateful to those who have given evidence to the review. I would like to thank Lord Bew and the panel for this progress report. I look forward to considering the panel’s findings in the summer.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Lord Bew said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       This progress report gives a picture of the range of evidence and opinion submitted to the review. There is no attempt to draw conclusions at this early stage; this will be the task of the final report. We would particularly like to thank all those who have given evidence. We are very grateful for the way in which people have conveyed their opinions, often strongly held. We will be sure to consider these in full as we move towards the final recommendations.
      </p>
