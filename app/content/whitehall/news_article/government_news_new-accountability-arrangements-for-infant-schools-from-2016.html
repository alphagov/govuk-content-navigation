      On 27 March 2014, we published our
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/new-national-curriculum-primary-assessment-and-accountability">
       response to the consultation
      </a>
      on reforming the way we hold primary schools to account.
     </p>
     <p>
      We announced the introduction of the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-schools-and-colleges-more-accountable-and-giving-them-more-control-over-their-budget/supporting-pages/reception-baseline-assessment">
       reception baseline assessment
      </a>
      from 2016 as a new way of measuring primary schools’ progress.
     </p>
     <p>
      The baseline assessment will also allow us to monitor the progress of pupils in infant schools. From 2016, we will be able to measure and publish pupils’ attainment from reception year to the end of key stage 1 (
      <abbr title="key stage 1">
       KS1
      </abbr>
      ) for the first time. However, there will not be a floor standard for infant or first schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      Infant school pupils taking the reception baseline in 2016 will reach the end of
      <abbr title="key stage 1">
       KS1
      </abbr>
      in 2019, so we will first publish the progress of pupils in infant schools in the 2019
      <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance/" rel="external">
       performance tables
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      To help increase confidence and consistency in our moderation of infant schools, we will be increasing the proportion of schools where
      <abbr title="key stage 1">
       KS1
      </abbr>
      assessments are moderated externally. From summer 2015, half of all infant schools will have their
      <abbr title="key stage 1">
       KS1
      </abbr>
      assessments externally moderated.
     </p>
     <p>
      We will continue to support low attaining pupils through the low prior attainment funding. Once the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/progress-check-at-age-2-and-eyfs-profile#eyfs-profile">
       early years foundation stage (EYFS) profile
      </a>
      stops being compulsory in 2016, we will use the outcomes from the baseline assessment to allocate low priority funding to primary schools, including infant schools.
