      The Secretary of State for Education, Nicky Morgan, has today (10 June 2016) recommended
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/amanda-spiel-man">
       Amanda Spielman
      </a>
      for the post of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Spielman has been chosen as the preferred candidate because of her impressive breadth of experience across the education sector and her proven commitment to raising standards for children and young people. She co-founded ARK schools, one of the most successful academy chains in the country, which has transformed some of the most underperforming schools in the country. Since 2011, she has been Chair of the exam board regulator Ofqual, overseeing a significant and ambitious reform agenda which sees the introduction of an entirely new, more rigorous suite of A levels and
      <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
       GCSEs
      </abbr>
      . She is also a trustee of
      <abbr title="Science, technology, engineering and mathematics network">
       STEMNET
      </abbr>
      , a network which works with thousands of schools, colleges and employers to inspire young people to study and pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and maths.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over the past 5 years Ofsted has taken significant strides to improve its effectiveness, strengthening the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-from-september-2015">
       inspection handbook
      </a>
      and improving inspector training and quality. The
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/educational-excellence-everywhere">
       education white paper
      </a>
      outlined the next steps of inspection reform with a commitment to maintain parent confidence through robust and consistent inspections, while at same time ensuring inspections are focused on where they make a meaningful difference, reducing unnecessary burdens on schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      Having led one regulator through a period of similar change, and at the same time having helped to oversee the growth of a highly successful
      <abbr title="multi-academy trust">
       MAT
      </abbr>
      from 1 school to 34, Ms Spielman has precisely the right leadership experience to manage the organisation through the next period of reform and provide strong direction across the range of Ofsted’s functions, from schools and colleges to childcare providers and children’s services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I am delighted to recommend Amanda Spielman as Chief Inspector.
      </p>
      <p>
       From helping to set up one of the country’s top academy chains, to acting as a council member for the Institute of Education, to overseeing our ambitious qualification reform programme, Amanda has extensive experience at the frontline of the education system, making her uniquely qualified to take up this important role.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       I know that she is the right person to deliver the education white paper’s commitment to continue to improve the quality and consistency of Ofsted’s inspections, ensuring that it plays a central role in realising our vision of educational excellence everywhere.
      </p>
     </blockquote>

       The Secretary of State has now asked Neil Carmichael MP, Chair of the Education Select Committee, to arrange for the committee to meet Ms Spielman, and will consider the committee’s conclusions before deciding whether to proceed with the appointment by seeking Privy Council agreement.
