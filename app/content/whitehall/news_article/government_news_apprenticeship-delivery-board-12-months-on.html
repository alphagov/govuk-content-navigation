      The
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/apprenticeship-delivery-board">
       Apprenticeship Delivery Board (ADB)
      </a>
      , created to advise on expanding apprenticeships nationally, are working with the National Apprenticeship Service to increase the number of apprenticeship places that employers offer in both the public and private sector. The ADB is a key tool in driving the delivery of 3 million apprenticeship starts during this parliament.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chaired by David Meller, Chair of the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/apprenticeship-ambassador-network">

      Today’s event highlighted the many employers and intermediaries that the ADB have already engaged with, including the likes of Bauer Media, Claire’s Accessories, Harris Trust, Prudential and Yahoo!.
     </p>
     <p>
      Richard Harrington MP, was in attendance and he recognised five employers for their continued commitment to apprenticeships: Deloitte, Screwfix/Kingfisher, Leonard Cheshire Disability, Faccenda, and O2 – whilst also recognising the commitment of the ADB members.
     </p>
     <p>
      Screwfix’s CEO Andrew Livingston said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       We’re thrilled to receive this recognition. Screwfix launched ‘Your Guide to Hiring an Apprentice’ for our customers last year after we found that while the trade are supportive of apprentices, they are put off by the perceived costs and red tape involved in hiring their own.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       With shortages of trades, like electricians and plasterers, at their highest point in four years – there is still do much more to do to reverse this trend. We hope to make the process easier and help plug the skills gaps that exist.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      David Meller said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       This is an important milestone for the ADB. In the last 12 months we have engaged with leading employers in England to expand the current apprenticeship programme and to reach out to those not previously involved with apprenticeships. This is just the start of the journey and the very recent announcements on the Industrial Strategy and Institute for Apprenticeships will also be considered and embraced within the ADB brief.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       We couldn’t have achieved the great things we have so far had it not been for the commitment of the board and today we want to thank them for their support.
      </p>
