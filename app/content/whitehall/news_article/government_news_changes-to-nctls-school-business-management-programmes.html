      In line with our purpose to create a self-improving, school-led system, the National College for Teaching and Leadership (
      <abbr title="National College for Teaching and Leadership">
       NCTL
      </abbr>
      ) has stepped away from the design and provision of school business management (
      <abbr title="school business management">
       SBM
      </abbr>
      ) programmes.

     </p>
     <p>
      This is an opportunity for schools and organisations to take ownership of their leadership development and to ensure that the role of
      <abbr title="school business management">
       SBM
      </abbr>
      remains an important part of effective school leadership and school improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Accreditation of programmes delivered at Qualifications and Credit Framework (QCF) Diploma levels 4, 5 and 6 will be overseen by the Institute of Leadership and Management (
      <abbr title="Institute of Leadership and Management">
       ILM
      </abbr>
      ), who’ll also monitor and quality-assure the training providers.
