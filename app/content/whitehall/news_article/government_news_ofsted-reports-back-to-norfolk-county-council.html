        The focused inspections are part of a concerted programme of action by Ofsted to establish why children in some parts of the country have a much lower chance of attending a good or better school than their peers in other similar areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Twenty-eight schools were inspected during the focused inspection period 12 to 22 March, including: two infant schools; two junior schools; 16 primary schools; six secondary schools; and one pupil referral unit (PRU). The schools were all due for inspection by the end of this academic year.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the inspections, Ofsted also gathered information on the use, quality and impact of local authority support for school improvement by asking three additional key questions of headteachers and governors.

          Ofsted announced the first wave of focused school inspections across local authority areas, where children are being denied the standard of education they deserve, on 17 January 2013. The press release is available on the Ofsted website.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Local authority areas were selected for the focused school inspection programme that took place during the spring 2013 term on the basis of the relative proportion of children attending good or better primary schools, as set out in the last Ofsted Annual Report, and Ofsted data on the proportion of children attending good or better secondary schools, as well as any relevant inspection evidence gathered during the autumn 2012 term. These are standard section 5 inspections, which were scheduled to take place this academic year and include all types of schools – although the majority will be primary schools.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The most recent published data shows that in Norfolk a child has a 63% chance of attending a good or better primary school and only a 54% chance of attending a good or better secondary school.
