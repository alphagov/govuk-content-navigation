        Schools Minister Nick Gibb congratulated thousands of primary school children, teachers and support staff on their hard work, as results for Key Stage 1 assessments were published.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Minister highlighted the importance of a good primary education and stressed the need for all children to have a solid grounding in the “three Rs” by the age of seven. He also said it was vital that we narrow the attainment gap between the richest and poorest areas of the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been no change between 2009 and 2010 in the percentage of pupils achieving Level 2 or above in speaking and listening, writing, mathematics and science. There is a single percentage point increase at Level 2 or above in reading. At Level 3, there is a single percentage point decrease in mathematics, and a single percentage point decrease in science.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Key Stage 1 assessment results are available on the Department’s website.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Thousands of teachers work hard every year to deliver these important assessments and today I’d like to thank them and the pupils themselves.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         In spite of the hard work of teachers and pupils, today’s results show that there are still too many seven-year-olds not reaching the expected level in these important subjects. We need to make sure that Government gives schools the support they need to get the basics right.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         These results also show an unacceptable attainment gap between local authorities where we know there are a high proportion of children on Free School Meals, and richer areas. Tackling educational inequality is our top priority, and our pupil premium will provide support for the poorest pupils in our schools.
        </p>
       </blockquote>

          At Key Stage 1, schools use national tasks and tests in reading, writing and mathematics, alongside their observation of children’s work throughout the year to reach an overall judgement on the level the child has reached in each subject.
         </p>
        </li>

         <p>
          Schools are required to report teacher assessment levels in reading, writing, speaking and listening, mathematics and science.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Local authorities have a duty to moderate Key Stage 1 teacher assessment judgements in 25 per cent of their schools each year, prioritising teachers new to Key Stage 1 in order to provide professional development.
