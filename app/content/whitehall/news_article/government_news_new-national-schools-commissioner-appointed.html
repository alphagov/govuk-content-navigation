        A new National Schools Commissioner has been appointed by the Department for Education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sir David Carter, currently the Regional Schools Commissioner (
        <abbr title="regional school commissioners">
         RSC
        </abbr>
        ) for the South West, will succeed Frank Green who completes his term as Schools Commissioner at the end of January 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sir David will play a key role in the government’s education reforms, leading the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/schools-commissioners-group/about/our-governance">
         team of 8 RSCs
        </a>
        to tackle underperformance and ensure all schools across the country are providing their pupils with an excellent education. This will include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         supporting the creation of new academies and free schools
        </li>
        <li>
         intervening in failing and coasting local authority schools, exercising the new powers to be introduced through the
         <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2015-16/educationandadoption.html" rel="external">
          Education and Adoption Bill
         </a>
         currently before Parliament
        </li>
        <li>
         recruiting high-quality academy sponsors
        </li>
        <li>
         improving the performance of underperforming academies and free schools
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Sir David Carter has previously worked as the
        <abbr title="chief executive officer">
         CEO
        </abbr>
        of the highly successful Cabot Learning Federation, one of the first multi-academy trusts in the country. He received a knighthood in the Queen’s birthday honours in 2013 in recognition of his services to education over 30 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister Lord Nash said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         David Carter has already made an outstanding contribution to the government’s academy reforms in the South West as one of our first regional schools commissioners.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         His considerable expertise as an outstanding school leader makes him the ideal choice to build on the significant legacy of Frank Green as the National Schools Commissioner.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Responding to his appointment Sir David said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         This job is a wonderful opportunity to make a difference to the learning of children across our schools led system.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         My aim will be to work with the regional commissioners, academy leaders and trustees to challenge all schools to perform better than ever before and deliver educational excellence everywhere.
        </p>
