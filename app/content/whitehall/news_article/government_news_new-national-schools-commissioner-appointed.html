      A new National Schools Commissioner has been appointed by the Department for Education.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sir David Carter, currently the Regional Schools Commissioner (
      <abbr title="regional school commissioners">
       RSC
      </abbr>
      ) for the South West, will succeed Frank Green who completes his term as Schools Commissioner at the end of January 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sir David will play a key role in the government’s education reforms, leading the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/schools-commissioners-group/about/our-governance">
       team of 8 RSCs
      </a>
      to tackle underperformance and ensure all schools across the country are providing their pupils with an excellent education. This will include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       supporting the creation of new academies and free schools
      </li>
      <li>
       intervening in failing and coasting local authority schools, exercising the new powers to be introduced through the
       <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2015-16/educationandadoption.html" rel="external">
        Education and Adoption Bill
       </a>
       currently before Parliament
      </li>
      <li>
       recruiting high-quality academy sponsors
      </li>
      <li>
       improving the performance of underperforming academies and free schools
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Sir David Carter has previously worked as the
      <abbr title="chief executive officer">
       CEO
      </abbr>
      of the highly successful Cabot Learning Federation, one of the first multi-academy trusts in the country. He received a knighthood in the Queen’s birthday honours in 2013 in recognition of his services to education over 30 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister Lord Nash said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       David Carter has already made an outstanding contribution to the government’s academy reforms in the South West as one of our first regional schools commissioners.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       His considerable expertise as an outstanding school leader makes him the ideal choice to build on the significant legacy of Frank Green as the National Schools Commissioner.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Responding to his appointment Sir David said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       This job is a wonderful opportunity to make a difference to the learning of children across our schools led system.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       My aim will be to work with the regional commissioners, academy leaders and trustees to challenge all schools to perform better than ever before and deliver educational excellence everywhere.
      </p>
