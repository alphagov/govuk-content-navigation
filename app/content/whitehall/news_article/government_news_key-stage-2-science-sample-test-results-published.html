        Provisional national results showing Key Stage 2 attainment in science sample tests have been published.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sample test was administered by five per cent of schools, and taken by 27,210 pupils.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proportion of 11-year-olds reaching the expected standard or above (Level 4 or above) was 81 per cent. The percentage achieving Level 5 was 28 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        The figures can be found on the Department’s research and statistics website.
       </p>
       <p>
        A Department for Education spokesman said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         We are committed to raising standards in science at all levels, including Key Stage 2 by ensuring children are taught the fundamental scientific knowledge they need to progress - one of the main reasons we are not proceeding with the previous Government’s planned primary curriculum is that it risked watering down traditional subjects.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         We also recognise that good quality science teaching is crucial if we are to get more children to engage and excel in their science education and new policies - such as with the expansion of Teach First in primary schools - will ensure more highly educated science graduates come into teaching.
        </p>
       </blockquote>

       <p>
        In total, 27,210 pupils at 747 schools took part in the science sampling test. The tests were administered on 14 May 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        Provisional Key Stage 2 test results for English and mathematics were published on August 3, alongside teacher assessment scores for the same subjects and science for Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3. These results are also available on the Department’s research and statistics website.
