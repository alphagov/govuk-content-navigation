        The inspections are part of a concerted programme of action by Ofsted to establish the effectiveness of a multi-academy trust in supporting and challenging academy schools within individual chains.
       </p>
       <p>
        Five academies were inspected as part of the focused inspection between 2 and 5 June 2015. Two of these were full inspections and 3 were monitoring inspections. The academies were all due for an inspection by the end of this academic year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with the inspections, telephone discussions were held with the principals of 7 other academies. A follow-up visit to The Education Fellowship was also conducted where inspectors spoke to senior and operational staff, principals, governors, strategic partners and other stakeholders. Inspectors also scrutinised a range of relevant documentation.

         clarifying the arrangements for the focused inspection of academies. In the first week, Ofsted inspects a number of the trust’s academies. Inspectors also hold telephone conversations with other academy principals. In the following week inspectors now visit multi-academy trust central offices and hold discussions with staff from the trust. They consider a range of other evidence alongside the results from the focused inspections.
