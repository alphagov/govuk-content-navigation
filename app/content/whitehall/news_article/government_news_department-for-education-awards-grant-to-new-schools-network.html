      Following a competitive bidding process, the Department for Education has approved grant funding for New Schools Network (
      <abbr title="New Schools Network">
       NSN
      </abbr>
      ) to provide pre-application support to parents, teachers and community groups and others hoping to open free schools. The grant will also allow
      <abbr title="New Schools Network">
       NSN
      </abbr>
      to support free schools in the pipeline and open free schools.
      <abbr title="New Schools Network">
       NSN
      </abbr>
      is a registered charity.
     </p>
     <p>
      The grant will be for the financial years 2014 to 2015 and 2015 to 2016. There is an option to extend the grant for 1 year beyond this.
     </p>
     <p>
      The grant is expected to commence on 1 April 2014, subject to final negotiations on the grant agreement. This will be published in due course.
     </p>
     <p>
      The grant was awarded after a rigorous bid assessment conducted by senior department officials.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some 15 groups requested information about how to bid for the grant, with 3 applications being made.
      <abbr title="New Schools Network">
       NSN
      </abbr>
      was judged to have submitted the strongest bid as evaluated against the published award criteria.
     </p>
     <p>
      Read the letter from the department, informing NSN of their successful bid.
