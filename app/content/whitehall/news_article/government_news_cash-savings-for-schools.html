        Ahead of the new academic year, schools are being urged to take advantage of special deals negotiated by the government that could save them thousands of pounds on their energy,
        <abbr title="information and communications technology">
         ICT
        </abbr>
        equipment and printers and photocopiers.
       </p>
       <p>
        All publicly funded schools are free to make use of these pre-existing contracts, and on average they could save up to 10% on energy and over 40% for printers and photocopiers, also known as ‘multi-functional devices’ (
        <abbr title="multi-functional devices">

        are typically 10% compared to the average market rate. The deal is tailored to make it easier for schools to access, and schools can join the deal when their current deal(s) expire. For
        <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">
         MATs
        </abbr>
        , this means there is no need to amend all the current deals to expire at the same time before joining. All you need to do to access the deal is complete the transfer forms.

         energy deals represent consistent service, benchmarked savings and solid assurance. This comfort comes from being in a framework with a large buying organisation dedicated to the public sector as a whole. I would wholeheartedly recommend to those charged with managing utility services or facilities in academies that they take a good look at
         <abbr title="Crown Commercial Service">
          CCS

         and their energy contracts.

        Schools could make savings of over 40% on printers, copiers, scanners or multi-functional devices, with over 3,300 schools already benefiting from this

        Having identified a product that suited their requirement, Fitzjohn’s Primary School purchased 2 digital machines at 40% less than their previous costs. The £5,000 saving went towards improving student learning, with new art materials and more after-school clubs. The money also supported the school’s kitchen refurbishment.

        “This deal delivers big savings and peace of mind - certainly best value. I’ve recommended it to other business managers and they’re seeing great results” said Frank Swan, Business Manager at Fitzjohn’s Primary School.
