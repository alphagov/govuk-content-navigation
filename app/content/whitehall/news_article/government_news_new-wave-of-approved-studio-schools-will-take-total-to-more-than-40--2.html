        The Government today announced that 13 new Studio Schools are set to open from September 2014 - backed by more than 100 major national and local employers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Studio Schools allow 14- to 19-year-olds to study academic subjects through practical projects designed and delivered by employers. Pupils combine core GCSEs and vocational qualifications with real work experience at places like the UK Space Agency - for those aged 16 or over this is up to two days and usually paid.  Most Studio Schools operate longer days and terms, mirroring the workplace.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Studio School projects have all been approved to move to pre-opening stage and will be situated across England. Pupils in Studio Schools will study core GCSEs alongside vocational qualifications. This should enable them to leave with the knowledge, skills and attitude to work that employers demand. The projects approved today will specialise in a range of subjects including business, retail, ICT, marine manufacturing, engineering and digital technologies and will cater for around 4,000 young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        These 13 Studio Schools join 15 that are already preparing to open and 16 currently open. Together they will create opportunities for almost 14,000 young people, preparing them for the world of work by developing transferrable employability skills - punctuality, good communication, reliability and team working - whilst enabling students to gain a strong grounding in English, maths and science.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister Lord Nash said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I am delighted to be approving such a strong field of Studio Schools to the next stage. More employers are getting involved in Studio Schools, demonstrating their commitment to preparing young people - who will be their future employees - for the world of work.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         It is crucial for young people to have the skills and experience vital to employers, both for their own prosperity and to help us compete in the global race.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Schools Commissioner Dr Elizabeth Sidwell said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         I am delighted that we have been able to approve more Studio Schools to open. These schools will put young people in communities across the country in touch with their local employers and will give them valuable experience of the workplace, while still studying for their core academic qualifications.  They are crucial in helping those young people who prefer practical learning to pick up the skills wanted by employers, and it is great to see so many organisations working together to improve the life chances of young people.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Chair of the Studio Schools Trust Geoff Mulgan said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Today’s announcement is very good news for both young people and employers. Studio Schools are spreading - and will soon be a network of over 40 - because they’ve shown their worth in providing young people with the skills and attitudes they need to make a success of work and life. Young people learn better when they’re tackling real life problems, and they learn better when there’s a clear line of sight linking what they do in school to future jobs and careers.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         All of the existing studio schools should be very heartened by this vote of confidence.  But in many ways this is just the beginning.  Studio Schools are becoming a movement whose goal couldn’t be more important:  to make the most of otherwise wasted potential, and connect learning to the very best of science and enterprise in all its forms.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The latest round of approved projects will enjoy input from more than 100 local and national employers, giving them direct involvement in shaping the future workforce. Employers say they are struggling to find the skills they are looking for in school leavers. Last year’s CBI annual education and skills survey showed that almost two-thirds - 61 per cent - of employers were unsatisfied with the self-management skills of school leavers. Employers were also not satisfied with their literacy and numeracy skills - 35 per cent and 30 per cent respectively.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anu Ojha, Director of the National Space Academy Programme at the National Space Centre, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The UK’s space industry is one of this country’s best-kept secrets - amongst the fastest growing sectors of the UK economy (nearly 10 per cent per year) with 29,000 employees, a turnover to the country of more than £9 billion per year and world-leading expertise in space robotics, satellite communications and a host of other space technologies.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         One of the biggest challenges for the sector is sustaining this growth - to achieve its potential the UK space industry will need new entrants at both degree level and higher apprenticeship technical level. The Banbury Space Studio School, with its proximity to Harwell (the UK’s science campus for space science and particle physics with thousands of engineers, technicians and scientists on site) and support from the UK space sector, will be well placed to make a tangible contribution not only to the growth prospects for the sector but also to the aspirations of the young people studying at the Studio School who wish to become part of this successful and inspiring industry.
        </p>
       </blockquote>

        Notes to editors:
       </h3>
       <ol>
        <li>
         <p>
          The successful Studio Schools have been through a rigorous process including assessment and interview by the Department and the Education Funding Agency (EFA).
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Studio Schools are an innovative way for employers to get involved in helping to give young people the skills businesses need. They equip young people, who prefer practical learning, with the qualifications and skills to help companies prosper. Study is combined with work placements with local and national employers who are involved in the school.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          They teach a rigorous academic and vocational curriculum to typically 300 students aged 14 to 19. All Studio Schools offer GCSEs in English, maths and science and other GCSEs and vocational qualifications which are recognised by employers and universities.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         Studio Schools differ from other schools in the way they deliver these qualifications:
         <ul>
          <li>
           All subjects are taught through projects designed with employers.
          </li>
          <li>
           They typically operate longer days and outside standard school terms - giving pupils a good understanding of a working day, and the importance of good attendance and punctuality in business.
          </li>
          <li>
           Alongside their studies, pupils carry out work placements for four hours a week with employers who partner with the school. After age 16, this increases to two days a week and pupils are usually paid for this work.
          </li>
          <li>
           Each pupil has a ‘personal coach’ who replicates the role of a supportive line manager in the workplace. Coaches also help students get the most out of the curriculum and their work placements.
          </li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          In addition to the 13 approved today, 16 Studio Schools are already open and a further 15 are working to open either this September or September 2014 (see below table).
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         The Department has recently published arrangements for inviting the next wave of applications on its website.  There will be two Studio School application rounds a year, the next ones being in September 2013 and spring 2014.  Guidance, application forms and the precise application deadlines for the next round will be published in May 2013.
