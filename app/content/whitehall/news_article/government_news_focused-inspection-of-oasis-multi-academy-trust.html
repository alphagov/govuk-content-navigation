        Ofsted today (25 June 2015) publishes the outcome letter of the first focused inspection of a multi-academy trust under the new arrangements, agreed with the Department for Education earlier this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The inspections are part of a concerted programme of action by Ofsted to establish the effectiveness of a Multi-Academy Trust in supporting and challenging academy schools within individual chains.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ten academies were inspected as part of the focused inspection between 2 and 5 March 2015. Eight of these were full inspections and 2 were monitoring inspections. The academies were all due for an inspection by the end of this academic year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with the inspections, telephone discussions were held with the principals of 20 other academies and inspectors undertook a follow-up visit to Oasis’ national office. As part of this visit, discussions were held with senior and operational staff from the trust, principals, governors, strategic partners and other stakeholders. Inspectors also scrutinised a range of relevant documentation.

         clarifying the arrangements for the focused inspection of academies. In the first week, Ofsted inspects a number of the trust’s academies. Inspectors also hold telephone conversations with other academy principals. In the following week, inspectors now visit multi-academy trust central offices and hold discussions with staff from the trust. They consider a range of other evidence alongside the results from the focused inspections.

         Oasis Community Learning Trust (OCL) was established in 2004. There are now 44 academies in the trust. These include 16 secondary academies, 2 all-through academies and 26 primary academies. The academy trust has grown rapidly, taking on 30 new academies in the last three years; 17 of these have joined in the last 2 years. There is one teaching school in the trust. Academies are now organised into regions, each led by a Regional Academy Director.
