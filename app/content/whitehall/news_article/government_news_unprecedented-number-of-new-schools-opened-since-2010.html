      New figures show the government has approved an unprecedented number of new schools since 2010. More than 400 new free schools and technical schools have been approved across England, amounting to more than 200,000 new school places.
     </p>
     <p>
      These new schools are a vital part of the government’s plan for education as they increase choice for parents and help to drive up standards across the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since 2010 the government has opened:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        more than 250 free schools
       </b>
       - new schools set up and run by teachers, parents and charities, rather than local councils or Westminster politicians. 79 of these open for the first time this term, while a further 76 are in the pipeline
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        30 University Technical Colleges
       </b>
       - new colleges developed in partnership with universities and employers that train young people for careers in key industries such as engineering and science. More than 500 employers are now involved in
       <abbr title="university technical colleges">
        UTCs
       </abbr>
       , including Hitachi Rail Europe, Jaguar Land Rover and Bentley. 13 of these
       <abbr title="university technical colleges">
        UTCs
       </abbr>
       open for the first time this term, and a further 26 are in development
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        37 studio schools
       </b>
       - new schools that prepare young people for the workplace by offering a rigorous academic education alongside employer-backed technical and vocational qualifications. More than 400 employers are involved in studio schools, including the BBC, Barclays, Sony and Talk Talk. 12 of these studio schools open for the time this month, and a further 9 are in development
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      These diverse schools have introduced new ideas and approaches to the system that are increasingly helping all schools to raise standards, with more children now having the opportunity to go to a good or outstanding school than ever before.
     </p>
     <p>
      The number of openings in just over 4 years is underlined by the fact that it took 4 years to open the first 27 academies, and 7 years to open the first 70 academies. Only 15 City Technology Colleges were opened in 5 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also since 2010 more than 900 weak schools have been turned into sponsored academies - this means they are now getting the help they need from strong sponsors with a proven track record of improving education for pupils in long-term under-performing schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      A further 2,800 schools have been granted academy freedoms. These include powers to set the length of the school day and term and freedoms over how they spend their money and design their curriculum.
     </p>
     <p>
      It means that in total there are now more than 4,000 academies in England - almost 20 times as many as there were in May 2010, when all 203 academies were sponsored secondary schools. 87% of academies support other schools in some way, leading to a system of school-to-school support where institutions share expertise and challenge one another in order to improve standards across the sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Delivering the best schools and skills for our young people is part of our long-term economic plan and opening more free schools, academies,
       <abbr title="university technical colleges">
        UTCs
       </abbr>
       and studio schools is vital to this as they help to drive up standards for all.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       They help those parents that want to exercise choice, but I know that many parents just want their child to be able to go to a good local school. In helping to raise standards for all, these new free schools, academies and others are helping to make this possible.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Analysis shows free schools are helping young people from all backgrounds fulfil their potential. The vast majority of mainstream free schools (72%) are in areas most in need of more school places, while half of all free schools are in the 30% most deprived communities in England.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among the new schools opening their doors for the first time this term are:
     </p>
