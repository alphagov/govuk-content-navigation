      Today the government has published a
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/draft-0-to-25-special-educational-needs-sen-code-of-practice-draft-regulations">
       consultation giving more details of plans to overhaul the special educational needs system
      </a>
      to ensure that all children and young people with
      <abbr title="special education needs">
       SEN
      </abbr>
      receive the extra assistance they need.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alongside draft regulations, the government has issued a revised, clearer 0 to 25
      <abbr title="special education needs">
       SEN
      </abbr>
      Code of Practice which provides practical advice for professionals and families on how to support children and young people with
      <abbr title="special education needs">
       SEN
      </abbr>
      . The new code reflects the changes being introduced by the Children and Families Bill, such as the introduction of personal budgets and reformed arrangements for 16- to 25-year-olds in further education and training.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, the government is also consulting on the timetable for transition to the new system, which will be phased in from September 2014. We want all children and young people with
      <abbr title="special education needs">
       SEN
      </abbr>
      and their families to benefit from the improved arrangements as soon as possible, while at the same time ensuring that the best possible service is maintained during the transition.
     </p>
     <p>
      We are also publishing the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/impact-evaluation-of-the-send-pathfinder-programme">
       latest evaluation reports of the
       <abbr title="special education needs">
        SEN
       </abbr>
       pathfinder programme
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Edward Timpson, Minister for Children and Families, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Too many families find themselves in a battle with a system that’s supposed to help them. Our reforms will fundamentally transform the system so that children and young people with
       <abbr title="special education needs">
        SEN
       </abbr>
       receive a joined up approach that meets their needs.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Families who are testing our reforms have already said they have greater control over the support they receive. With a year to go until the roll out of new system, we expect local authorities to hit the ground running to ensure all families can benefit as quickly as possible from this comprehensive support.
      </p>
