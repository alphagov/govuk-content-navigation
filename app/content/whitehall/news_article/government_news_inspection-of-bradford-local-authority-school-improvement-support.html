        Ofsted today publishes the outcome letter of its inspection of Bradford Council’s arrangements for supporting school improvement. This inspection is part of a programme by which Ofsted inspects how local authorities support and challenge all schools in their areas to get better.
       </p>
       <p>
        This inspection took place between 15 and 19 June 2015, when discussions were held with local authority officials, councillors, school leaders and others with an interest in education in the borough.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inspectors also took into account the focused inspections of 8 schools and undertook a telephone survey of a sample of 14 school leaders. They reviewed documentation which included the local authority’s evaluation of its own effectiveness, recent improvement strategies, reports to elected members and school performance data provided to schools.
