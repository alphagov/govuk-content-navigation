     <p>
      Higher education in the UK enjoys a world-class reputation, with globally renowned teaching and cutting-edge research and innovation. However, the higher education landscape has changed fundamentally since the last major legislative reforms of 1992, leaving us with a university system that needs important reform to fulfil its potential and to sustain our global standing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Combining the existing regulatory functions of Higher Education Funding Council for England (
      <abbr title="Higher Education Funding Council for England">
       HEFCE
      </abbr>
      ) and the Office for Fair Access (
      <abbr title="Office for Fair Access">
       OFFA
      </abbr>
      ), the Office for Students (
      <abbr title="Office for Students">
       OfS
      </abbr>
      ) will act as a single body to regulate the sector with a strong focus on choice and competition. This includes a renewed focus on widening participation and ensuring more students from disadvantaged backgrounds can benefit from studying at our excellent universities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <abbr title="Office for Students">
       OfS
      </abbr>
      chair, subject to parliamentary approval, will be tasked with leading the creation of the
      <abbr title="Office for Students">
       OfS
      </abbr>
      and setting out its direction in the coming years working with the executive team and the board. The chair will also take a leading role in the formation of the
      <abbr title="Office for Students">
       OfS
      </abbr>
      including advising the Secretary of State on the recruitment and selection of the non-executive board and the key executive positions of chief executive and director for fair access and participation, ensuring they incorporate a range of experience noted in the bill and reflect the diversity of the sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Universities Minister Jo Johnson said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       By creating the Office for Students, we will put student choice, teaching quality and social mobility at the top of the agenda in higher education.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       The role of the chair will be vital in delivering this aim and ensuring there is direct link with the sector. I look forward to working with the successful applicant on delivering these important reforms.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Candidates will be shortlisted and interviewed by a panel that will be chaired by a public appointments commissioner and includes Nicola Dandridge, Chief Executive of Universities UK, David Currie, Chair of the Competition and Markets Authority and Neil Carberry, Director for People and Skills at the CBI, alongside a government representative.
