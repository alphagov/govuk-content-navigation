      Skills and Apprenticeships Minister Robert Halfon said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I’m looking forward to meeting the many aspiring students, young people and apprentices who want to get on in their chosen career.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Events like the Skills Show are essential in giving people of all backgrounds and all ages the skills they need to get on the ladder of opportunity.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      In addition to this, the National Apprenticeship Service will also be hosting events for employers working with the Apprentice Ambassador Network (AAN), Federation for Small Business (FSB) and World Skills UK.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sue Husband, director, National Apprenticeship Service said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The Skills Show is an important event in our calendar as it gives us a fantastic opportunity to show young people, considering their future career ambitions, the range of careers on offer through apprenticeships. With over 1500 job roles in over 170 industries, there is an apprenticeship for everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       We will be talking to lots of young people, parents and teachers to share information on apprenticeships and to encourage more of them to consider an apprenticeship as a route to a rewarding career. We want to show that no matter who you are, or where you are from, or what career ambitions you have, an apprenticeship will help you achieve your career goals.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The Skills Show also includes ‘Have a Go’ experiences. across five industry zone areas - Hospitality and Lifestyle, Construction and Infrastructure, Engineering and Technology, IT and Enterprise and Media and Creative – young people, parents and teachers can access information on careers, career routes and ‘Have a Go’ at many of the careers being showcased.
