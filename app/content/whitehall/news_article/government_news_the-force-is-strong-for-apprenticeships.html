        The creation of the Apprenticeship Delivery Board to advise on how best to expand the apprenticeship programme was announced alongside plans from hundreds of new employers to develop new apprenticeships in sectors including Film and TV, Real Estate and Veterinary Nursing. It was also announced that 26 new Trailblazer groups will design apprenticeships in 39 exciting and varied occupations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Employers such as Pinewood Studios, which is involved in making the new Star Wars film, and designer shoemakers Loake, have formed 26 new Trailblazer groups to create apprenticeship standards in a variety of sectors. These 26 groups, which also consist of employers Rolls Royce, Dr. Martens and English National Opera, will design apprenticeships in 39 occupations, and existing Trailblazer groups will design an additional four.
       </p>
       <p>
        Skills Minister Nick Boles said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Pinewood Studios was home to the new Star Wars film. Now the force is strong with young apprentices who will get the opportunity to boost their skills in a wide range of roles including TV and film set design. These apprentices will have the expertise their industry needs.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Our Trailblazer programme allows employers across the country to have their say in training tomorrow’s workforce, helping us achieve 3 million apprenticeships by 2020.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        These announcements come on the same day that another Trailblazer employer, RBS, announced it is recruiting 400 apprentices on the Financial Services Account Management Apprenticeship programme they helped design.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government also confirmed the creation of a new Apprenticeship Delivery Board, which will report to Skills Minister Nick Boles MP, and will work directly with the National Apprenticeship Service to stimulate interest in, and take up of apprenticeships. It will be jointly chaired by David Meller and Richard Harrington MP, the Prime Minister’s Advisor on Apprenticeships.
       </p>
       <p>
        Richard Harrington MP, Joint Chairman of the Apprenticeship Delivery Board said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         The creation of the Apprenticeship Delivery Board is further proof of the incredible commitment that this Government has to apprenticeships, which will give so many more people the opportunity to earn a wage, and gain a valuable qualification and skill that they will have for life. As Joint Chairmen of the Apprenticeship Delivery Board David Meller and I look forward to supporting the Government in making the three million target a reality during the course of this Parliament.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        David Meller, Joint Chairman of the Apprenticeship Delivery Board said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Through my work as Chair of the National Apprenticeship Ambassadors Network I have seen first-hand just what a difference apprenticeships can make to people’s lives, and how beneficial they can be for employers who gain loyal and skilled staff that add genuine value to their business. I am delighted to be joining Richard as Joint Chairman of the new Apprenticeship Delivery Board, and supporting the delivery of three million apprenticeships.
