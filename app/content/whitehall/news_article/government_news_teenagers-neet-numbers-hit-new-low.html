        The figures show the proportion of 16- to 18-year-olds
        <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">
         NEET
        </abbr>
        has fallen by 0.6 percentage points to 4.7% in the last 12 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the lowest level since comparable records began in 2011, with a total drop of 1.4 percentage points - equivalent to 24,000 people - over this 4-year period.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been a continuing downward trend in young people
        <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">
         NEET
        </abbr>
        since the government raised the participation age so that
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/know-when-you-can-leave-school">
         young people in England must continue in education or training beyond 16
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Only last month, data was published showing the number of
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/neet-statistics-quarterly-brief-october-to-december-2014">
         16- to 24-year-olds

          NEET
         </abbr>
         from October to December
        </a>
        had reached its lowest level since 2007.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/neet-data-by-local-authority-2012-16-to-18-year-olds-not-in-education-employment-or-training">
         today’s figures
        </a>
        , in 80% of local authorities the proportion of young people reported as
        <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">
         NEET
        </abbr>
        has fallen compared with last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The figures also show the number of 16- to 18-year-olds whose activity is ‘not known’ has also fallen, but the government will be contacting areas where the ‘not known’ are unacceptably high.
       </p>
       <p>
        Skills Minister Nick Boles said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Equipping young people with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed is absolutely central to this government’s long-term economic plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am therefore delighted at today’s figures, which reinforce the recent evidence we saw of a return to
         <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">
          NEET
         </abbr>
         levels not seen since before the economic crisis, and show that our long-term economic plan is working.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         There is more to do, however, and I would urge councils which don’t have information on large proportions of their teenage population to do more to identify them and help them fulfil their potential.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The government has carried out a number of important reforms which benefit young people post-16, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         introducing a rigorous new curriculum and world-class qualifications focused on the subjects universities and employers value the most
        </li>
        <li>
         ensuring young people who have not achieved at least a C in
         <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
          GCSE
         </abbr>
         English or maths must continue studying those subjects up to the age of 18
        </li>
        <li>
         removing low-quality vocational qualifications from league tables in favour of courses proven to deliver the skills employers demand
        </li>
        <li>
         establishing a careers and enterprise company which will encourage greater collaboration between schools and employers to deliver information and inspiration on careers
        </li>
       </ul>
