      The number of 16- to 18-year-olds
      <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">
       NEET
      </abbr>
      has fallen to its lowest level since comparable records began in 2011, figures reveal today (19 March 2015).
     </p>
     <p>
      The figures show the proportion of 16- to 18-year-olds
      <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">
       NEET
      </abbr>
      has fallen by 0.6 percentage points to 4.7% in the last 12 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is the lowest level since comparable records began in 2011, with a total drop of 1.4 percentage points - equivalent to 24,000 people - over this 4-year period.
     </p>
     <p>
      There has been a continuing downward trend in young people
      <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">
       NEET
      </abbr>
      since the government raised the participation age so that
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/know-when-you-can-leave-school">
       young people in England must continue in education or training beyond 16
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Only last month, data was published showing the number of
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/neet-statistics-quarterly-brief-october-to-december-2014">
       16- to 24-year-olds
       <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">
        NEET
       </abbr>
       from October to December
      </a>
      had reached its lowest level since 2007.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/neet-data-by-local-authority-2012-16-to-18-year-olds-not-in-education-employment-or-training">
       today’s figures
      </a>
      , in 80% of local authorities the proportion of young people reported as
      <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">
       NEET
      </abbr>
      has fallen compared with last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The figures also show the number of 16- to 18-year-olds whose activity is ‘not known’ has also fallen, but the government will be contacting areas where the ‘not known’ are unacceptably high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Skills Minister Nick Boles said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Equipping young people with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed is absolutely central to this government’s long-term economic plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am therefore delighted at today’s figures, which reinforce the recent evidence we saw of a return to
       <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">
        NEET
       </abbr>
       levels not seen since before the economic crisis, and show that our long-term economic plan is working.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       There is more to do, however, and I would urge councils which don’t have information on large proportions of their teenage population to do more to identify them and help them fulfil their potential.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The government has carried out a number of important reforms which benefit young people post-16, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       introducing a rigorous new curriculum and world-class qualifications focused on the subjects universities and employers value the most
      </li>
      <li>
       ensuring young people who have not achieved at least a C in
       <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
        GCSE
       </abbr>
       English or maths must continue studying those subjects up to the age of 18
      </li>
      <li>
       removing low-quality vocational qualifications from league tables in favour of courses proven to deliver the skills employers demand
      </li>
      <li>
       establishing a careers and enterprise company which will encourage greater collaboration between schools and employers to deliver information and inspiration on careers
      </li>
     </ul>
