        Religious groups have today (28 December 2015) backed the government’s decision to issue robust
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-religious-studies">
         guidance
        </a>
        that protects the freedom of schools to set their religious studies curriculum in line with statutory guidance and in accordance with the wishes of parents.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recent Judicial Review of the religious studies
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        ruled on a narrow, technical point, the meaning of which the Department for Education has now clarified, meaning there is therefore no need to seek permission to appeal from the Court of Appeal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead, the government has issued guidance to schools that sets out clearly that schools will not have to change their religious education curriculum and that there is no need to give non-religious world views equal parity with religious world views in education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some campaign groups have subsequently tried to claim that this means that non-religious beliefs such as humanism must be taught on a par with study of religion. However the guidance issued by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan today makes clear that schools can continue to prioritise the teaching of major faiths over non-religious world views such as humanism.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, the guidance reiterates requirements that non-faith schools must reflect the fact that the religious traditions in Great Britain are, in the main, Christian while taking account of the teaching and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government will also press ahead with the religious studies
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        . The judge explicitly said that there was nothing unlawful in the content of the
        <abbr title="religious studies">
         RS
        </abbr>
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        itself. The judge made clear that there was “no challenge” to the content of the
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         This government is determined to protect schools’ freedom to set their own religious studies curriculum, in line with the wishes of parents and the local community.
        </p>
        <p>
         The guidance I have issued today makes absolutely clear that the recent judicial review will have no impact on what is currently being taught in religious education.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         I am clear that both faith and non-faith schools are completely entitled to prioritise the teaching of religion and faith over non-religious world views if they wish.
        </p>

        Reverend Nigel Genders, Chief Education Officer for the Church of England, said:

       <blockquote>
