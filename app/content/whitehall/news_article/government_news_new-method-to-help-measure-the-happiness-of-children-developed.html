        Children’s Rights Director, Dr Roger Morgan said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The happiness of children is a hugely debated topic and there has been much research into what is meant by happiness. I wanted to ask children themselves what they thought happiness was so that I could better understand what makes them happy, or unhappy.
        </p>
        <p>
         What children told me about their own happiness has helped me to develop a really useful tool, which will provide the methodology for future research into the happiness of children in care in England.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         A powerful finding from working with children themselves on how to measure happiness was that children agreed more about what makes them unhappy than about what makes them happy.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        During focus discussion groups, children and young people were asked what they thought the definition of happiness was. They thought happiness had a lot to do with being satisfied with how things are for you. One group said happiness wasn’t one thing, but could depend on lots of different things for different people. Another group suggested that it could be to do with doing different things with other people, from sex to laughing a lot.
       </p>
       <p>
        The children agreed that people are not born happy or unhappy, but are made happy or unhappy by what happens to them. One person summed this up by saying: ‘Can’t be born happy, but can be born into happiness.’
       </p>
       <p>
        When asked if money can make you happy, some children said that being treated equally and fairly, and having family, is more important than how much money you have.
       </p>
       <p>
        Children in the discussion groups said that being safe and well looked after, having all the basic things you needed, being treated fairly and with respect, being able to make your own decisions and do things you wanted to do, stability, and having support from family and friends, all helped to make children and young people happy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The things that the children felt could make a child unhappy included lack of trust, being bullied, people being prejudiced against you, being treated unfairly, losing somebody who matters to you, not being cared for properly, being abused, not being listened to, being excluded from things, not being told things you needed to know, and being let down by people who should be supporting you.
