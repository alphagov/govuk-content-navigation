      Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, has today written letters to 3 exceptional school leaders to congratulate them on their success in supporting significant improvement in other schools, as well as their own.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the last few months, Sir Michael has asked inspectors to nominate leaders who have been instrumental in raising standards and improving the prospects of youngsters in previously under-performing schools. Today’s letters are the first to be issued as part of this new initiative to recognise exceptional system leadership.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sir Michael said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I’m very pleased to celebrate the achievements of these 3 exceptional leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have all taken risks, put themselves out there and spread good practice beyond their own schools. They are reformers who have turned their ambitions for success into reality, and raised standards for children not only at their own schools, but at other schools nearby.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       We need more great leaders in our education system. By recognising these three people, I hope others will be inspired to follow their example and take every step necessary to improve the prospects and life chances of children in their own schools and in others.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The 3 exceptional leaders are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Dr Tom Canning OBE, Executive Head at Tollgate Primary School in east London, who also took on the role of Executive Head at the nearby Cleves Primary School. Under Tom’s leadership, Cleves moved from ‘requires improvement’ in 2013 to achieve an ‘outstanding’ Ofsted rating in November 2015.
      </li>
      <li>
       Bradley Taylor, Headteacher at Chiltern Gate School in Buckinghamshire, who also took on the role of interim Head at nearby Maplewood School. Under Bradley’s leadership, Maplewood moved from ‘inadequate’ in 2014 to be judged ‘good’ in November 2015.
      </li>
      <li>
       Kerrie Lewis, Headteacher at Condover Church of England Primary School in Shropshire, who also took on the role of acting Headteacher at nearby Shrewsbury Cathedral Catholic School. Under Kerrie’s leadership, Shrewsbury moved from ‘inadequate’ in July 2014 to be judged ‘good in November 2015.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Sir Michael will continue to write to exceptional leaders throughout the year, and the names of every recipient will be published in Ofsted’s 2016 Annual report on education and skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today’s letters have also been sent to the Secretary of State for Education, Nicky Morgan.
