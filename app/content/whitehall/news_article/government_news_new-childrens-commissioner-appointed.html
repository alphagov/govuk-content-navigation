      The Secretary of State for Education, Nicky Morgan, has today (13 November 2014) announced the appointment of Anne Longfield
      <abbr title="Order of the British Empire">
       OBE
      </abbr>
      as the next Children’s Commissioner for England.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Longfield, chief executive of 4Children - a national charity which works to support children, young people and families - will take up her post on 1 March 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      Her 30 years’ experience in developing, influencing and shaping the agenda for children and families across Parliament and government have made her the outstanding candidate to oversee the Office of the Children’s Commission for the next 6 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Anne Longfield
      <abbr title="Order of the British Empire">
       OBE
      </abbr>
      will replace the current Children’s Commissioner for England Maggie Atkinson, who has held the post since 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I am delighted to appoint Anne to the role, and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Maggie for all her hard work over the last 4 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anne has shown relentless dedication and drive to improving the lives of children and young people during a career spanning over 30 years, and I know she shares my commitment to championing children’s rights and safeguarding their interests - particularly the most vulnerable.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       I have absolutely no doubt that her strong track record in children and young people’s services and the passion she has demonstrated throughout her career will make a real difference to the lives of children across the country as she takes the helm at the Office of the Children’s Commissioner.
      </p>
     </blockquote>

       I am delighted and hugely privileged to have been appointed as the next Children’s Commissioner for England.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a vitally important role with the potential to make a real difference for children in this country - especially for those vulnerable children who need our protection and support the most.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       I very much look forward to taking up the post next year.
