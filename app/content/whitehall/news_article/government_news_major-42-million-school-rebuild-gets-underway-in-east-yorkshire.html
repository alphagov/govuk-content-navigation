        The school is 1 of 10 in Hull and East Riding of Yorkshire to be rebuilt under the first phase of the government’s priority school building programme (
        <abbr title="priority school building programme">
         PSBP
        </abbr>
        ), worth £2.4 billion, which will address the needs of 260 of the schools in England in the worst condition.

        Thanks to the
        <abbr title="priority school building programme">
         PSBP
        </abbr>
        , pupils and teachers attending the school are set to benefit from a £4.2 million, fit-for-purpose rebuild that will see the existing buildings demolished, with a new 2-storey school built and the existing dining block retained.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister David Laws said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The start of construction work at Francis Askew Primary School marks a key milestone for the priority school building programme in east Yorkshire and an exciting phase in the development of the school.
        </p>
        <p>
         Delivering great new schools will help to build a stronger economy and a fairer society, so that every young person across the region can get on in life.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Vital building work is taking place at schools in the worst state across the country. We are making good progress with 16 school buildings now open - 55 are under construction and the remaining projects are well into the development or planning stages.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Excited students and staff from the school were joined by council dignitaries, representatives from the Education Funding Agency (
        <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
         EFA
        </abbr>
        ) and the contractor, Galliford Try Construction, for a turf cutting ceremony to celebrate the start of work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Work on the main building at Francis Askew Primary School is due for completion by October 2015, and the project will be fully complete by April 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        Improving the standard of school buildings so that pupils learn in high quality classrooms and teachers have access to the best facilities is a vital part of the government’s plan for education.

        , school buildings are being rebuilt faster and cheaper than those built under the previous school building initiative - building schools for the future (
        <abbr title="building schools for the future">
         BSF
        </abbr>
        ). Under the

        it took 3 years for construction work to begin. This was slashed to 1 year for the
        <abbr title="priority school building programme">
         PSBP
        </abbr>
        , with projects costing around a third less.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Monday 9 February the government announced details of the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/6-billion-investment-to-rebuild-and-improve-schools-across-england" rel="external">
         second phase of the

          PSBP
         </abbr>
        </a>
        , worth around £2 billion, which will see a further 277 school buildings rebuilt or refurbished bringing the total to 537 schools to benefit over the life of the programme.
