      The school is 1 of 10 in Hull and East Riding of Yorkshire to be rebuilt under the first phase of the government’s priority school building programme (
      <abbr title="priority school building programme">
       PSBP
      </abbr>
      ), worth £2.4 billion, which will address the needs of 260 of the schools in England in the worst condition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thanks to the
      <abbr title="priority school building programme">
       PSBP
      </abbr>
      , pupils and teachers attending the school are set to benefit from a £4.2 million, fit-for-purpose rebuild that will see the existing buildings demolished, with a new 2-storey school built and the existing dining block retained.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister David Laws said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The start of construction work at Francis Askew Primary School marks a key milestone for the priority school building programme in east Yorkshire and an exciting phase in the development of the school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Delivering great new schools will help to build a stronger economy and a fairer society, so that every young person across the region can get on in life.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Vital building work is taking place at schools in the worst state across the country. We are making good progress with 16 school buildings now open - 55 are under construction and the remaining projects are well into the development or planning stages.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Excited students and staff from the school were joined by council dignitaries, representatives from the Education Funding Agency (
      <abbr title="Education Funding Agency">
       EFA
      </abbr>
      ) and the contractor, Galliford Try Construction, for a turf cutting ceremony to celebrate the start of work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Work on the main building at Francis Askew Primary School is due for completion by October 2015, and the project will be fully complete by April 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      Improving the standard of school buildings so that pupils learn in high quality classrooms and teachers have access to the best facilities is a vital part of the government’s plan for education.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thanks to the
      <abbr title="priority school building programme">
       PSBP
      </abbr>
      , school buildings are being rebuilt faster and cheaper than those built under the previous school building initiative - building schools for the future (
      <abbr title="building schools for the future">
       BSF
      </abbr>
      ). Under the
      <abbr title="building schools for the future">
       BSF
      </abbr>
      it took 3 years for construction work to begin. This was slashed to 1 year for the
      <abbr title="priority school building programme">
       PSBP
      </abbr>
      , with projects costing around a third less.
     </p>
     <p>
      On Monday 9 February the government announced details of the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/6-billion-investment-to-rebuild-and-improve-schools-across-england">
       second phase of the
       <abbr title="priority school building programme">
        PSBP
       </abbr>
      </a>
      , worth around £2 billion, which will see a further 277 school buildings rebuilt or refurbished bringing the total to 537 schools to benefit over the life of the programme.

       Thanks to decisions which have been taken to improve efficiency and reduce waste in central school building programmes, significant work on those projects is already underway - as of 28 January 2015, 16 school buildings are already open, 55 are under construction and the remaining projects are well into the development or planning stages.

       In May 2014 the government announced a further £2 billion for the second phase of the programme.
