      Schools Minister David Laws said more scholarships and bursaries would be available to help recruit the most talented graduates with the potential to be brilliant teachers in key subjects. This would help raise standards in schools and ensure all children were given a good education.
     </p>
     <p>
      Scholarships, awarded by respected subject organisations, will be available to the most talented maths, physics, chemistry and computing trainees. Bursaries will be available to top graduates in maths, physics, chemistry, computing, and languages, in primary and in priority subjects at secondary school (English, history, biology, geography, music, and design and technology).
     </p>
     <p>
      The government introduced scholarships in 2011. Since then, 425 high-quality graduates in maths, physics, chemistry and computing have been attracted to teaching through the scheme. A further 680 teacher training scholarships will be available for trainees starting in the 2014 to 2015 academic year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The following changes to scholarships and bursaries are being introduced for the 2014 to 2015 academic year:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       scholarships for graduates training to teach maths, physics, chemistry and computing with a 2:1 or better will increase from £20,000 to £25,000. The scholarship is paid instead of the standard bursary
      </li>
      <li>
       bursaries for graduates training to teach maths and physics with a 2:1 will increase from £15,000 to £20,000, matching bursaries for those with a first. For those with a 2:2, bursaries will increase from £12,000 to £15,000. New bursaries of £9,000 will be introduced for maths and physics trainees with a relevant degree and a good A level in the subject (a grade B or higher)
      </li>
      <li>
       bursaries for graduates training to teach computing with a first or 2:1 will increase to £20,000, from £9,000 and £4,000 respectively. New bursaries will also be introduced for those with a 2:2, worth £15,000
      </li>
      <li>
       graduates training to teach design and technology will receive bursaries worth £9,000 for those with a first and £4,000 for those with a 2:1
      </li>
      <li>
       bursaries for primary maths specialists with a 2:1 degree will increase from £6,000 to £11,000, matching bursaries for those with a first. New bursaries will be introduced for those with a 2:2, worth £6,000
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The following bursaries will continue at the same level as in the 2013 to 2014 academic year:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       graduates training to teach maths, physics, chemistry and modern languages with a first will continue to receive bursaries worth £20,000
      </li>
      <li>
       graduates training to teach chemistry and modern languages with a 2:1 will continue to receive £15,000, while those with a 2:2 will continue to receive £12,000
      </li>
      <li>
       graduates training to teach English, history, biology, geography, music and primary with a first class degree will continue to receive £9,000, and those with a 2:1 will continue to receive £4,000
      </li>
      <li>
       primary maths specialists with a first will continue to receive £11,000
      </li>
     </ul>

       The increase in the number of scholarships available allows us to offer a larger number of physicists the opportunity to become inspirational teachers and helps us increase the subject expertise in physics education. Through the scheme we hope to forge relationships that will endure beyond the scholars’ period of teacher training. We aim to develop a network of outstanding physics teachers, who will become part of a community of physicists across schools, universities and business.

       The scholarships we awarded last year have been a great success, with excellent feedback from the trainees on the learning and confidence they have gained as chemistry teachers, and the support they have received through the scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Royal Society of Chemistry is committed to ensuring that students get the best chemistry education. To achieve this, we need to increase the number of chemistry-qualified teachers who teach the subject, who can engage and inspire students with their enthusiasm and confidence in their subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       To ensure we have the scientists we will need in the future – to deliver excellent research that will drive growth and solve challenges from energy and climate change to new healthcare solutions – we need to start with inspirational teaching. Many of today’s great scientists will tell you that they were inspired by a science teacher at school.

       We are delighted the scholarship scheme is running again this year. It is also very significant that there is a substantial increase in the value of the scholarships to be awarded this year. The value is now not that much less than the average annual earnings of a full-time worker in the UK. The scholarship should help us to attract the very best people to become teachers. Taken with the increase in the other bursaries available for teacher training, the incentives for becoming a computing teacher are now on a par with other subjects such as physics and maths.
