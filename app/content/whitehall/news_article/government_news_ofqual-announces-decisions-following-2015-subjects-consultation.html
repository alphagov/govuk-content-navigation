        New GCSEs, AS and A levels are being introduced for a number of subjects for first teaching in 2015. Qualifications currently offered in these subjects will be replaced by new qualifications based on updated content requirements. For example, the existing GCSE maths will be replaced directly by the reformed GCSE maths for first teaching in 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following its June 2014 consultation, Ofqual has decided that a small number of additional current qualifications should also be withdrawn. This is because the qualifications in these subjects are too similar to one or more of the subjects being reformed for first teaching in 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        These subjects are:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          AS and A levels in applied art and design
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          AS and A levels in applied business
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          AS and A levels in human biology
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          AS and A level economics and business (combined course)
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          GCSE digital communication
         </p>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        No new schools or colleges will able to offer these subjects from September 2015.
However schools or colleges already offering these subjects can accept new students in 2015 for the final time.  For these schools and colleges the final award will be in 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        This announcement relates to subjects being reformed for first teaching in 2015 and decisions have not yet been made about any subjects that overlap with those being reformed for first teaching in 2016 and 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        In our June consultation, we also included a set of proposals on how subject content should be developed.  We are still considering the best approach to this and so are not announcing decisions at this stage.
