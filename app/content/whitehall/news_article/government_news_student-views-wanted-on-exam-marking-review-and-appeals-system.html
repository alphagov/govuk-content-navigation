      We want young people to have their say on the system which governs how students and schools can ask for a GCSE, AS or A level result to be reviewed.
     </p>
     <p>
      We are writing to 6,500 schools and colleges on Monday 22 February to ask for their help in encouraging students to
      <a href="http://bit.ly/OfqualSurvey" rel="external">
       complete a short online survey
      </a>
      about changes being proposed to the marking review and appeals system.
     </p>
     <p>
      Julie Swan, Acting Executive Director for General Qualifications, Ofqual said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       We consult before making changes to qualification arrangements so that we can take into account the views of people who have an interest in the system. Our proposed changes are designed to make the system fairer, more effective and transparent. The people who respond to our consultations are usually adults, especially those who work in the education sector and we’d really like to have more input from young people who are directly affected by the marking review and appeals system.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The survey asks four questions adapted from part of
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/marking-reviews-appeals-grade-boundaries-and-code-of-practice">
       our full consultation
      </a>
      , which runs until 11 March. The survey focuses on particular issues that we feel would be of interest to students.
     </p>
     <p>
      To help students understand our proposals we have produced the video below.
