        <abbr title="Department for Education">
         DfE
        </abbr>
        Character Awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Applicants should be able to prove their programme develops character traits, attributes and behaviours that underpin success in school and work, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         perseverance, resilience and grit
        </li>
        <li>
         confidence and optimism
        </li>
        <li>
         motivation, drive and ambition
        </li>
        <li>
         neighbourliness and community spirit
        </li>
        <li>
         tolerance and respect
        </li>
        <li>
         honesty, integrity and dignity
        </li>
        <li>
         conscientiousness, curiosity and focus
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The government wants to celebrate the excellence and diversity in this field, recognising that character is already being encouraged, nurtured and developed alongside academic rigour through a variety of programmes in and outside schools across the county.
       </p>
       <p>
        Character education can be found within a school’s ethos, in the classroom and on the playground, as much as it can be found on the sports field and outside of school in the local community. Research has shown that both universal and targeted programmes can be effective, with excellent approaches including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         integration into the curriculum and wider aspects of a school
        </li>
        <li>
         the teaching of character as a separate subject
        </li>
        <li>
         extra-curricular activities, such as sport and music
        </li>
        <li>
         outward facing activities, such as community work and volunteering
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Through these approaches in character education pupils can emerge from school more fully rounded and better equipped to meet the challenges of employment and future life. That’s why applicants should offer evidence that proves their programmes have had an impact on engagement, attainment or employment outcomes.

        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/measures-to-help-schools-instil-character-in-pupils-announced">
         Character Awards were announced on 8 December
        </a>
        as part of the £5 million Character Innovation Fund to support the development of character in schools. The government will shortly be opening applications for a
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/character-education-apply-for-2015-grant-funding">
         grants programme
        </a>
        to fund innovative projects and build capacity in this field, as outlined in the announcement on 16 December: ‘

         England to become a global leader of teaching character

        .’

       <p>
        Commenting on the announcement of the Character Awards, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Delivering the best schools and skills is a key part of our long-term economic plan that is turning Britain around.
        </p>
        <p>
         As well as high academic standards, this means providing opportunities for all young people to develop the character and resilience they need to succeed in modern Britain.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         The new Character Awards schools will help give schools and organisations the tools and support they need to ensure they develop well-rounded pupils ready to go on to an apprenticeship, university or the world of work.
        </p>
