      New figures show that changes to toughen up the skills tests taken by prospective teachers have raised the quality of those entering the teaching profession.
     </p>
     <p>
      New more demanding rules introduced in September 2012 have ensured only high-quality candidates with good levels of literacy and numeracy go on to train to be teachers. This will raise standards in schools. As a result, the Department for Education will not be bringing in new tests.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since 1 September 2012 applicants:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       must sit and pass both skills tests (literacy and numeracy) before starting a teacher training course - previously they did not have to sit and pass the tests before starting teacher training
      </li>
      <li>
       must clear a higher pass mark on both tests - this has raised the standard for entry into teaching
      </li>
      <li>
       are limited to 2 resits per test - previously they could take the tests an unlimited number of times - this change has ended the excessive resit culture of previous years; candidates who fail to pass after 2 resits cannot reapply to teacher training for 2 years
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Under the previous system, the proportion passing was very high - 98% of candidates in the 2011 to 2012 academic year passed both skills tests and so could progress to qualified teacher status.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2011 to 2012:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       1,050 candidates had not passed the numeracy test after 5 attempts
      </li>
      <li>
       270 candidates had not passed the literacy tests after 5 attempts
      </li>
      <li>
       20 candidates had not passed both tests after 20 attempts
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Results of the first cohort of applicants to teacher training sitting the tests under the new rules show that 88% passed both tests within 3 attempts. 12% did not pass both skills tests in 2012 to 2013. Almost 3% failed 3 times and cannot progress to teacher training for at least 2 years.

      A Department for Education spokesperson said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The robust changes to the skills tests have had the desired effect, raising the bar for entry into teacher training and ensuring that high-quality graduates are entering the profession. This is raising standards in schools.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       We will continue to evaluate the skills tests to make sure even more brilliant teachers are entering the classroom.
