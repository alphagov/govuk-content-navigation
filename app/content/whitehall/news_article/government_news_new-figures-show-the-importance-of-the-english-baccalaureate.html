        Commenting on today’s publication of statistics showing outcomes for 19-year-olds in England in 2010, Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         These statistics underline the importance of studying the core academic subjects that make up the English Baccalaureate - young people who achieve good grades in these subjects are more likely to go on to higher education and less likely to be NEET.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Publishing information on EBacc attainment will increase the opportunities for all young people - especially those in disadvantaged areas - to study these vital subjects.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Today’s statistics show that:
       </p>
       <p>
        Of those who achieved the EBacc:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         80% were in full-time education at age 19 - 81% of them were in higher education
        </li>
        <li>
         3% were NEET at age 19
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Of those who achieved five GCSE passes at A* to C or equivalent including English and maths:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         67% were in full-time education at age 19 - 67% of them were in higher education
        </li>
        <li>
         5% were NEET at age 19
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Of those who achieved five GCSE passes at A* to C or equivalent not including English and maths:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         61% were in full-time education at age 19 - 60% of them were in higher education
        </li>
        <li>
         6% were NEET at age 19

        English Baccalaureate subjects are: English, maths, geography or history, the sciences and a language.
       </p>
       <p>
        16% of 16-year-old learners achieved the English Baccalaureate in 2009/10.  22% of pupils were entered for subjects that covered all the component parts of the English Baccalaureate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of those who achieved the EBacc combination:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         95 per cent went on to study at level 3 (A level standard) post-16, with 44 per cent getting the equivalent of at least one A and 16 per cent getting the equivalent of three As.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Of those who achieved the benchmark of five GCSES passes at A*-C or equivalent including English and maths:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         75 per cent of whom went on to level 3 study, 24 per cent getting at least one A and seven per cent getting three.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Since 2004, the number of non-academic qualifications taken up to age 16 has risen from about 15,000 to about 575,000, with a higher take-up of vocational qualifications by young people from deprived backgrounds.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2002 around 75% of pupils attempted a modern foreign languages subject. In 2010, this figure was just over 43%.
       </p>
       <p>
        Science (single, double or additional sciences) fell by roughly 60,000 between 2006/07 and 2009/10.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a large gap between FSM and non-FSM pupils’ achievements - only 8% of FSM pupils took the EBacc, with 4% achieving it; whilst 24% of non-FSM pupils took the EBacc and 17% achieved it.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2009 just 4% of free school meal (FSM) pupils took chemistry or physics.  Fewer than one in five did history and fewer than 15% took geography or French. 24% of FSM pupils entered an MFL subject compared with 43% of non-FSM pupils doing likewise.
       </p>
       <p>
        4.9% of pupils in Academies (including former CTCs and independents) gained the English Baccalaureate. This compares with 15.1% in maintained schools nationally. However, overall results in Academies continue to improve faster than the national average.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2009, 4% of schools in England had no Key Stage 4 entries for geography, and 2% had no KS4 entries for history. 1% of schools did not enter a single KS4 pupil for either subject.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proportion of pupils entering GCSE geography declined from 44% in 1997 to 27% in 2009, and those entering history declined from 35% to 31%. Over the same period, the proportion of pupils entering GCSE religious studies increased from 17% to 26%.
