        Schools across England are set to take part in an international literacy study.

        The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (
        <abbr title="Progress in International Reading Literacy Study">
         PIRLS
        </abbr>
        ) measures the reading ability of 10-year-olds, which can then be compared with other countries. The study is run by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (
        <abbr title="International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement">
         IEA
        </abbr>
        ) on a 5-yearly cycle. The next round of the study takes place later this year and will be delivered through Pearson Education and Oxford University in England.
       </p>
       <p>
        A randomised sample of 170 schools from across England have been selected to take part, and will have been contacted by the
        <abbr title="Progress in International Reading Literacy Study">
         PIRLS

        recruitment team. Teachers and pupils do not need to prepare for the test.
