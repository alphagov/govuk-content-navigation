      The new
      <a href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">
       Skills Funding Service (SFS)
      </a>
      will enable:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       secure access to contract information
      </li>
      <li>
       a simplified process for providers to access their contract information
      </li>
      <li>
       quicker response times for queries
      </li>
      <li>
       reduced carbon footprint, providers no longer need to print off contracts to sign and return, whilst continuing to ensure an audit trail of contractual documents
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We have developed the new service with provider feedback in mind, following conversations and surveys with more than 300 providers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The new service has already been used for issuing and receiving signed electronic versions of ESF contracts for the 2014 to 2020 programme and is now being extended for:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Adult Skills Budget 2015 to 2016 contract variations
      </li>
      <li>
       Adult Education Budget 2016 to 2017 contracts
      </li>
      <li>
       16 to 18 apprenticeships/traineeships 2015 to 2016 contract variations and 2016 to 2017 contracts
      </li>
      <li>
       Advanced Learner  Loans 2015 to 2016 contract variations and 2016 to 2017 contracts
      </li>
      <li>
       AGE 2015 to 2016 contract variations and 2016/17 contracts
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      To ensure access to your contracts for these programmes, including being able to make changes and returns, and receive prompt payment for any increases to your 2015/2016 and future 2016 to 2017 contract variations, you will need to ensure your staff register for the contract authoriser role in the Hub role management system by 31 May.
     </p>
     <p>
      We will soon be contacting colleges’ and other training organisations’ contract authorisers with more information about accessing the new SFS.
