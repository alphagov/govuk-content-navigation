      Nine outstanding practitioners in character education, one from each of the English regions including one national winner, were celebrated today (1 July 2016) at a presentation that took place as part of the inaugural Association of Character Education (
      <abbr title="Association of Character Education">
       ACE
      </abbr>
      ) conference, held at the University of Birmingham School.
     </p>
     <p>
      Children and Families Minister Edward Timpson announced the 2016
      <abbr title="Department for Education">
       DfE
      </abbr>
      Character Award winners at the event, held by
      <abbr title="Association of Character Education">
       ACE
      </abbr>
      to support schools, teachers and other educationalists to develop traits like confidence, perseverance and resilience in young people; traits that support academic attainment, are valued by employers and enable young people to make a positive contribution to British society.
     </p>
     <p>
      First introduced in 2015 by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, the awards celebrate excellence and diversity in this field, recognising that character is already being encouraged, nurtured and developed alongside academic rigour through a variety of programmes inside and outside schools across the country. The awards demonstrate that character education can be found within a school’s ethos, in the classroom and on the playground, as much as it can be found on the sports field and outside of school in the local community.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       I congratulate those organisations winning an award today for their efforts to support young people to develop the positive character traits that can make a difference to thousands of lives. We know that qualities such as self-control, confidence, perseverance and the ability to bounce back from adversity underpin future success and well-being. We want to ensure that all young people have opportunities to develop these traits, and as the awards show us today, this is something that the best already do.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Children and Families Minister Edward Timpson said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       I’m delighted to announce Thoresby Primary School in Hull as the national winner of the Character Awards, alongside the 8 others receiving regional awards today. They’ve been rightly recognised for showing tremendous commitment to instilling positive character in young people, and their work demonstrates the breadth of ways that character can be developed, from sport and music activities, to youth social action and the development of an ethos around specific traits. I congratulate them all.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Charlotte Hill, Chair of the Character Awards judging panel and Chief Executive of Step Up To Serve, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       The benefits of getting involved in character-building activities in and out of school extend well beyond the classroom. Taking part sets young people up to lead happy and successful lives at the same time and make a positive contribution to society.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Danielle Brown,
      <abbr title="Member of the Order of the British Empire">
       MBE
      </abbr>
      , double Paralympic gold medallist and 3-time World Champion in archery, also on the Character Awards national judging panel commented:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Character has a big impact on success, from the classroom, the sports field or the workplace. In my career I’ve learned the value of determination, confidence and the ability to bounce back from setbacks. That is why I’m delighted that I was able to join the national panel to identify those schools and organisations that are leading the way to develop character traits in their pupils.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Co-op Academy focuses on character education based on self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity. To a population of students who are mostly identified as disadvantaged, the academy promotes participation in student council, enrichment activities and competitive sports. This is a co-operative academy with a focus on building character based on the co-operative values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity. The school’s vision for their students is to “be the best”. Character education is part of a deeply engrained moral purpose that runs through the academy and is aimed at making a significant impact on the life chances of students. A wide programme of character building activities take place, including random acts of kindness; art therapy; current affairs; and cross country running. The result is that there is a real understanding of civic virtues in all academy students.
