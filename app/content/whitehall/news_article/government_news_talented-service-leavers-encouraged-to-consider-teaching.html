        Former armed service personnel interested in a career in the classroom will today (11 February 2015) be able to apply for a unique school-based teacher training route through the expansion of the Troops to Teachers programme.
       </p>
       <p>
        Education Secretary Nicky Morgan today announced that the University of Brighton has been chosen to lead the expansion of the programme, which will be delivered in partnership with selected higher education institutions and schools across the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Troops to Teachers allows eligible service leavers without degrees, but who have gained qualifications or experiences in the services - for example: teaching, instructing, mentoring and coaching - to enrol on a salaried, 2-year, school-based initial teacher training programme. Trainees will receive benefits including bespoke training and mentor support, and will gain a degree and qualified teacher status on successful completion of the programme.
       </p>
       <p>
        The expansion of the scheme follows feedback from headteachers on the positive impact trainees from the first 2 cohorts are already having in their schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        Troops to Teachers is one of a range school-based routes into teaching intended to make it easier for career changers to enter the profession, bringing with them the personal skills and experiences gained through their previous careers, including in the armed services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         As part of our plan for education we need excellent teachers in every classroom to prepare children for life in modern Britain.
        </p>
        <p>
         At a visit to a recent study week, I was able to see for myself the high calibre of the current trainees and the wealth of skills they can bring to teaching, including leadership, teamwork, resilience and the ability to inspire and engage.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         The feedback from headteachers on the positive impact career changers can have in their school has been outstanding, and I am pleased that Troops to Teachers is offering a route for talented service leavers to continue making an important contribution to their country by inspiring the next generation.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Professor Julian Crampton, Vice Chancellor, University of Brighton, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I am absolutely delighted that the University of Brighton is leading the expansion of the prestigious Troops to Teachers programme.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Career changers make an essential contribution to the teaching profession and this unique route into teaching allows trainees to benefit from the best combination of employment-based and blended learning experiences that exceed the capabilities of traditional on-site training.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Beverley Martin, Executive Principal, ISCA Academy, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         We’ve been so pleased with our involvement with the Troops to Teachers programme. It’s helped us strengthen some of our teams with high-quality trainees in shortage subjects like computer science and maths. Our Troops to Teachers trainees have proved themselves adaptable, flexible and passionate about teaching and learning.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Whether they stay with us as home-grown talent or move on to other schools, their focus and range of experience have made an important contribution in classrooms at ISCA.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Following a rigorous selection process, the expansion of Troops to Teachers will see a further 2 cohorts of highly skilled trainees begin their employment-based teacher training in September 2015 and September 2016 respectively.
       </p>
       <p>
        The programme has been specially designed to support the particular needs of those leaving the services and will focus on developing trainees’ knowledge and skills through classroom experience, school-based training and dedicated study days.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trainees will spend 2 years employed in schools that have been chosen for their strong record of delivering initial teacher training, including through other employment-based routes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Troops to Teachers forms part of the Department for Education’s commitment to the Military Covenant, which helps ensure service leavers get the support they need to make a successful transition back into civilian life.
