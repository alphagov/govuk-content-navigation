      An outstanding teenager who used his online blog to raise awareness about mental health issues received a prestigious award from Education Secretary Nicky Morgan today (2 February 2016).
     </p>
     <p>
      Student George Hunter, from Ponteland High School in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, Northumberland, picked up the annual
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lord-glenamara-memorial-prize-nominate-outstanding-pupils">
       Lord Glenamara Memorial Prize
      </a>
      during a ceremony at King’s College, London.
     </p>
     <p>
      George, a straight A and A* student and St John’s Ambulance volunteer, was the fourth winner of the annual prize open to high-achieving youngsters in years 11 and 12 across the north-east of England who have made positive civic contributions, often in their spare time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among George’s recent achievements was his ‘
      <a href="http://www.mytiediary.co.uk/" rel="external">
       My Tie Diary
      </a>
      ’ blog that was set up to encourage discussion about mental health and raise awareness on the subject.
     </p>
     <p>
      He had also found the time to run a series of Mandarin classes for year 9 pupils following on from his win in a national Mandarin speaking competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       George’s outstanding academic achievements and willingness to serve his wider community in various ways made him an incredibly deserving winner.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       I was delighted to meet George, and to present him with the Lord Glenamara Memorial Prize. Both he and the runners-up deserve great credit for what they have achieved, and I have no doubt they will go on to great things in the future.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Speaking after finding out he had won the Lord Glenamara Memorial Prize, George said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I am passionate for young people to be supported and educated at school on mental health and wellbeing, and I want to use this prize to promote this. When young people are properly supported, they cope better, learn better, and become more resilient.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       I will continue to encourage others to learn increasingly important languages, such as Mandarin.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      George could choose to undertake a 2-day work experience programme at the Department for Education’s central London offices following on from his win.
