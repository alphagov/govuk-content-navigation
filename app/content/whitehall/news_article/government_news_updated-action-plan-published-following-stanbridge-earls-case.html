      In June 2013, Ofsted completed its review of the inspection history of Stanbridge Earls School. The review concluded that each of the inspections conducted during the period examined was problematic but for different reasons. The review made 20 recommendations, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector accepted these and commissioned responsible officers to develop and implement a relevant action plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today (26 June 2014), Ofsted publishes the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/stanbridge-earls-school-review-findings-and-updated-action-plan">
       review findings with an updated action plan
      </a>
      , which confirms the actions that Ofsted has taken in response to the review.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Cross-Ofsted Safeguarding Group will keep under review the progress and impact of these improvements and will continue to report findings to Ofsted Executive Board and Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Debbie Jones, Ofsted’s National Director for Social Care and safeguarding lead said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       We deeply regret the errors that occurred in historic inspections of Stanbridge Earls School, during which inspections fell below the high standards we expect and that pupils and parents deserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today’s report and updated action plan show that Ofsted has taken decisive action to make the changes recommended in our review. We have made improvements to the way inspectors approach issues of safeguarding and welfare, bolstered by wider changes to make our systems, structures and processes more effective in protecting children and young people from harm.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       The safety, welfare and well-being of the young people in settings we inspect remain Ofsted’s primary concern. We will work to ensure this is at the core of inspection practice and to measure the impact of changes we have made.
      </p>
