       <p>
        The first reformed GCSEs, AS and A levels were introduced in England in September this year. Students will start being awarded new AS qualifications in summer 2016, and new GCSEs and A levels in summer 2017. Current rules mean that Exam Boards will no longer be able to award the unreformed or ‘legacy’ qualifications in the subjects where a reformed version of the qualification has been introduced beyond August 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        To make sure that students are not disadvantaged because of these changes, we are proposing that students taking legacy AS and A levels should have the opportunity to re-sit the qualifications, regardless of the subject and exam board, in summer 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        Students taking GCSEs in English, English language and mathematics (including linked pair maths GCSEs – ‘applications of mathematics’ and ‘methods in mathematics’) in summer 2016 will have a re-sit opportunity in November 2016. We are seeking views on whether these students should also have a further re-sit opportunity in May/June 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/resits-for-legacy-gcse-as-and-a-levels">
         consultation published today
        </a>
        , we propose that:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         <p>
          Re-sit opportunities in AS and A level subjects in which the new qualifications have been taught from September 2015, will be available in the legacy qualifications in May/June 2017. All AS and A2 level units for these qualifications will be available to all students in the normal way in the summer of 2016.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Students will be able to re-sit any AS or A2 level unit (including controlled assessment units) in the summer 2017 re-sit opportunity.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The same approach should be adopted in relation to legacy AS and A level qualifications in future tranches of reform.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          A re-sit opportunity will be made available for GCSEs in English, English language and mathematics (including linked pair maths GCSEs – ‘applications of mathematics’ and ‘methods in mathematics’) in November 2016. We are also seeking views on whether a further re-sit opportunity should be made available in May/June 2017
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Students will be able to carry forward the results of the speaking and listening controlled assessment in GCSE English and GCSE English language (including between the two subjects when re-sitting with the same exam board).
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          There will be no re-sit opportunities in other legacy GCSE subjects, although we are seeking views on whether a further re-sit opportunity should be made available for GCSEs in science subjects.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Our current proposals for GCSEs would mean that:
         </p>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <ul>
        <li>
         for GCSE English literature the last exams in the legacy qualifications will be in summer 2016
        </li>
        <li>
         for GCSE subjects that are to be first taught from September 2016 the final exams will be in summer 2017
        </li>
        <li>
         for all remaining legacy GCSEs and AS and A levels the final exams will be in summer 2018
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The consultation will be open until 2 February 2016.
