      Given recent questions about how the pupil premium will work it is significant and welcome news that the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) believe the premium is simple and transparent, and will benefit schools. The premium will start at £430 a year for every free school meals pupil, rising over the next four years. £2.5 billion will go to those students who need the most support.
     </p>
     <p>
      A spokesman for the Department for Education said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       We welcome the IFS comments on our pupil premium. As they have recognised, the pupil premium is ‘simple and transparent’ and will mean that many schools will see real-term increases in their funding, with the most deprived schools benefiting the most.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Through the premium we will provide £430 extra funding for every child on free school meals next year and this figure will continue to increase over the next four years. The money will go straight to schools and they will be free to decide how best to use it to help the poorest pupils increase their attainment.
      </p>
