      Co-ordinated by the National Apprenticeship Service, the week is designed to celebrate the positive impact apprenticeships and traineeships have on individuals, businesses and the economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 10th National Apprenticeship Week will bring together employers and apprentices from across England to celebrate the success of apprenticeships over the last decade and will seek to encourage even more people to choose apprenticeships as a fast-track to a great career.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apprenticeships and Skills Minister Robert Halfon said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       National Apprenticeship Week is about celebrating the best in apprenticeships and traineeships. The week highlights the vital role apprenticeships and traineeships play in giving people from all backgrounds a ladder of opportunity.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Last year’s National Apprenticeship Week saw some amazing achievements, but I want 2017 to be the best yet. I look forward to meeting apprentices and businesses throughout the week and showcasing the great work they do.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Sue Husband, director of the National Apprenticeship Service added:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       National Apprenticeship Week is an important date in the calendar as the week brings to the forefront of everyone’s minds the importance of helping to get more people to consider becoming an apprentice, whilst we celebrate the success apprenticeships bring to business.
      </p>
      <p>
       National Apprenticeship Week 2017 will be no different as it will raise awareness that the time is right for potential apprentices to get the skills they need for a great job, and for businesses, how they can grow their own talent whilst developing the motivated, skilled and qualified workforce they need.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       The 10th year of National Apprenticeship Week will be a huge celebratory event, reinforcing that apprenticeships can deliver for all employers, no matter what size their business is.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
