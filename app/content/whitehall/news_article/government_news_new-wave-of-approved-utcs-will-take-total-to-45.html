     <p>
      The Government today announced that 13 new University Technical Colleges are set to open from September 2014 - backed by more than 140 major employers and universities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The projects have all been approved to move to pre-opening stage and are spread across England. Each will specialise in demanding technical subjects, including engineering, digital technologies and biomedical science. More than 8000 young people will study at them. They will be taught core GCSEs alongside vocational qualifications, and will leave with the technical knowledge and skills, underpinned by academic rigour, that industry demands.
     </p>
     <p>
      These 13 UTCs join 27 that are already preparing to open and five currently open. Together they will allow around 27,500 students to train as the engineers, scientists and technicians of the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister Lord Nash said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I am delighted with the very strong field of UTC proposals we are progressing to the next stage. The growing number of top employers and universities involved in UTCs underlines the importance of making rigorous technical education an option for young people.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       It is vitally important that young people have the skills and experience wanted by employers, both for their own prosperity and to help us compete in the global race.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Lord Baker, Chairman of the Baker Dearing Trust, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I am delighted to see that the Government has today approved a further 13 University Technical Colleges to open around the country. UTCs are an innovative approach to education - designed to fill the skills gap in the UK by providing high quality training for technicians and engineers.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       The Baker Dearing Educational Trust has been working hard for the past five years to establish a national network of UTCs and today’s announcement will bring the total number to 45. This is excellent news for employers, students and the UK as a whole. We want to see a substantial increase in UTCs to build upon the proven success. I am therefore very pleased that the Department has announced the next round with applications to be submitted in September 2013.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Erich Thanner, HR Director, MINI Plants Oxford and Swindon, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       At MINI working with local partners to foster links between our factories and young people in the area is very important to us. We are very happy to support the proposed UTC and look forward to working in this partnership.
      </p>

      Notes to editors:
     </h2>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>
        The successful UTCs have been through a rigorous process including assessment and interview held in the Department in January this year.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        UTCs are Academies for 14- to 19-year-olds which focus on delivering technical education that engages young people and meets the needs of modern business. They offer full-time courses which combine practical and academic studies. Employers are put in the driving seat meaning that students benefit from a curriculum designed by experts in the field and are then supported to learn through work placements and access to industry standard facilities and equipment.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        All UTCs:
       </p>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Are sponsored by a local university and employers. Further education colleges and other educational institutions often work in partnership with them.
      </li>
      <li>
       Specialise in one or two curriculum areas (eg engineering, science).
      </li>
      <li>
       Teach core GCSEs alongside technical qualifications, and offer young people the opportunity to achieve the English Baccalaureate.
      </li>
      <li>
       Focus on disciplines requiring highly-specialised equipment, for example, engineering, manufacturing with product design and construction.
      </li>
      <li>
       Teach these disciplines alongside developing young people’s business, ICT, and design skills to prepare students for a range of careers and pathways at 19.
      </li>
      <li>
       Have 500 to 800 students.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>
        UTCs have the same freedoms as Free Schools and Academies. This allows them to be innovative in, for instance, in how they may choose to employ engineers with an industry background alongside qualified teachers; how they develop and deliver innovative projects for pupils; and how they extend the school year and day to prepare students for the world of work.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        In addition to the 13 approved today, five UTCs are already open and a further 27 are working to open either this September or September 2014 (see below table).
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        The Department has recently published on its website arrangements for inviting the next wave of applications. There will be two UTC application rounds a year - the next ones being in September 2013 and spring 2014. Guidance and application forms for the next round will be published in May 2013.
