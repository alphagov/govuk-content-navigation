      We have made further decisions about qualifications to be reformed for teaching from September 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      This follows our
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/decisions-for-completing-gcse-as-and-a-level-reform">
       initial decisions made in March
      </a>
      where we also confirmed the principles used to determine new GCSE and A level subjects that may be offered.
     </p>
     <p>
      At that time we published a list of subjects for which content will begin to be developed for new GCSEs and/or A levels. We also published a list of subjects that would not be reformed for 2017, and a list of those still under review because we needed additional information on how content requirements could be developed to meet our principles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today we’ve updated these lists. Some subjects, such as AS and A level creative writing, have been added to the list of subjects for which content may begin to be developed, while others will not be reformed at this time.
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/gcses-as-and-a-levels-new-subjects-to-be-taught-in-2015">
       Our summary explains our decisions
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      For the subjects we believe can meet our principles, exam boards will now be working with the Department for Education to develop core content, before submitting specifications to us for accreditation.
