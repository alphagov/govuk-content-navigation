        New wave of schools will help raise standards and improve choice
       </h2>
       <p>
        Thousands of pupils in England are set to benefit from high-quality academic study combined with practical learning as more studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs) open this September.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 11 new studio schools and three UTCs have the backing of business and industry, and offer young people an education that equips them with the skills employers want.
       </p>
       <p>
        The figures also mean that, between September 2011 and September 2012, a total of 97 new UTCs, studio schools and free schools have been opened by passionate teachers, parents, charities, employers and education groups. These schools are helping to give power back to teachers to raise standards in education, and are providing greater choice for parents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Studio schools offer academic and vocational qualifications, but teach them in a practical way. Study is combined with work placements - which are often paid placements - with local and national employers who are involved in the school. These include Fulham FC, the BBC, and the National Grid.
       </p>
       <p>
        UTCs are sponsored by a local university and employers, and they focus on providing technical education that meets the needs of modern business. Each has one or two specialisms - ranging from engineering, to manufacturing, to construction or bio-medical sciences.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both UTCs and studio schools are part of the government’s drive to ensure the education system responds to demands from employers for the skills they need to grow and prosper.
       </p>
       <p>
        Education Secretary Michael Gove said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         New studio schools and university technical colleges will ensure more young people get great jobs. They are a brilliant way for employers to get more involved in education so that young people can be better prepared than ever before for the world of work.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The UTCs and studio schools opening this September include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Aston University Academy of Engineering UTC, Birmingham, which will focus on engineering and science through a partnership between Aston University, the Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network (STEMNET) and a range of industry partners, including the National Grid.
        </li>
        <li>
         Hackney UTC, London, sponsored by Hackney Community College, the University of East London, BT and Homerton University Hospital, will specialise in medical technologies and new digital technologies, working closely with the pioneering start-up companies based in Hoxton.
        </li>
        <li>
         Hull Studio School, Hull, sponsored by outstanding-rated Hull College, will focus on business and enterprise and will provide young people with the essential employability skills they need to enter the world of work, by working with local employers such as British Land and Humberside Police.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Studio College for Construction and Building Excellence, Stoke-on-Trent, will specialise in construction and give students the opportunity to learn in a small, supportive environment to get the qualifications and training they need to be work ready. Sponsored by Stoke-on-Trent College, the studio school will work with a network of construction industry partners including Wates Construction.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        UTCs and studio schools are new schools for 14- to 19-year-olds. Pupils of all abilities can choose to go to them at ages 14 or 16. These schools typically operate on business hours, and many have shorter school holidays.
       </p>
       <p>
        Studio schools offer academic and vocational qualifications to around 300 pupils. Study is combined with work placements (which may be paid placements at post-16) with local and national employers who are involved in the school. Learning in this way encourages students to develop skills like punctuality, good communication, reliability and team working, whilst gaining a strong grounding in English, maths and science.
       </p>
       <p>
        David Frost CBE, Chair of the Studio Schools Trust, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         I am delighted that eleven new studio schools are opening this September, and the enthusiasm of parents and students for these schools is extremely heartening.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Lack of work readiness amongst school leavers is a key issue for businesses up and down the country, and studio schools are designed to address this concern. With their unique combination of mainstream qualifications, real work, and the development of employability skills and entrepreneurialism, studio schools will play a vital role in providing young people with the skills and experience that our economy needs.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        UTCs are sponsored by a local university and employers, and they focus on providing technical education. Each has one or two specialisms, and students split their time between studying core academic subjects and learning specific technical skills and qualifications.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lord Baker, Chair of the Baker Dearing Educational Trust, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         The UTC curriculum is built around projects created by employers. This brings education to life - students understand not just what they are learning, but why - and where they can go next. It’s hugely exciting, hugely motivating and just what young people want.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Employers report that they are struggling to find the skills they are looking for in school leavers. In the May 2010 CBI employer survey, more than two thirds of employers (70%) wanted to see the new government make the employability skills of young people its top education priority.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both UTCs and Studio Schools are part of the Government’s drive to ensure the education system responds to demands from employers for the skills they need to grow and prosper. They will also increase choice for parents and pupils in communities across the country.

         About University Technical Colleges. 
UTCs are academies for 14- to 19-year-olds. They focus on providing technical education that meets the needs of modern employers. They offer technical courses and work-related learning, combined with academic studies. 
All UTCs:
         <ul>
          <li>
           are sponsored by a local university and employers. It is also usual for FE colleges and other educational institutions - like established academy trusts - to work in partnership with them
          </li>
          <li>
           specialise in two curriculum areas (e.g. engineering and science)
          </li>
          <li>
           teach core GCSEs alongside technical qualifications, and we expect them to offer young people the opportunity to achieve the English Baccalaureate
          </li>
          <li>
           focus on disciplines that require highly specialised equipment, for example, engineering, manufacturing and construction
          </li>
          <li>
           teach these disciplines alongside developing young people’s business, ICT and design skills to prepare students for a range of careers and continuing education at 19
          </li>
          <li>
           have 500 to 800 students
          </li>
         </ul>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The Baker Dearing Educational Trust plays a key role in developing partnerships and advising on applications for UTCs. Two UTCs are already open - the first UTC, the JCB Academy in Staffordshire, opened in 2010 and then the Black Country UTC in Walsall opened in September 2011. A further 28 new UTCs are in the pre-opening phase and plan to open in 2013 and 2014.

         About Studio Schools. 
Studio schools are an innovative way for employers to get involved in helping to give young people the skills businesses need. They equip young people with the qualifications and skills to help companies prosper. Study is combined with work placements (which may be paid placements at post-16) with local and national employers who are involved in the school.
Studio schools are aimed at young people who learn in more practical ways. They teach a rigorous academic and vocational curriculum in a practical way to typically 300 students aged 14-19. All Studio schools offer GCSEs in English, maths and science and other GCSEs and vocational qualifications which are recognised by employers and universities.
Studio schools differ from other schools in the way they deliver these qualifications, to ensure that young people are developing the skills that local employers are looking for.
         <ul>
          <li>
           All subjects are taught through projects designed with employers
          </li>
          <li>
           They typically operate longer days and outside standard school terms - giving pupils a good understanding of a working day, and the importance of good attendance and punctuality in business
          </li>
          <li>
           Alongside their studies pupils carry out work placements for four hours a week, with employers who partner with the school. After age 16 this increases to two days a week and pupils are usually paid for this work.
          </li>
          <li>
           Each pupil has a ‘personal coach’, who replicates the role of a supportive line manager in the workplace. Coaches also help students get the most out of the curriculum and their work placements.
For many pupils and their parents, the opportunity to combine studying for qualifications with developing skills that will give them the edge in the competitive jobs market will be very attractive. For other students, the opportunity to gain qualifications through this new approach will mean they are more engaged and perform better than in a more conventional school.
Employers report that they are struggling to find the skills they are looking for in school leavers. In the May 2010 CBI employer survey, more than two thirds of employers (70%) wanted to see the new Government make the employability skills of young people its top education priority.
The Studio Schools Trust plays a key role in promoting studio schools and advising on applications for studio schools. Five studio schools are already open including the first two studio schools in Luton and Huddersfield which opened in September 2010 (of these 5, 2 are brand new free-standing academies and three have opened as part of existing institutions). Of the eleven studio schools opening this September, 9 are brand new free-standing academies and 2 will be part of existing institutions (Fulham and Ockendon). A further 16 studio schools (all brand new academies) are currently in the pre-opening phase.
