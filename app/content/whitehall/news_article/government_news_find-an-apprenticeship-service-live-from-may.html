      Launched in December 2014, the new
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-apprenticeship">
       ‘Find an apprenticeship’
      </a>
      system system has been designed to give users a more effective way to search and apply. They will also be able to gain quick and easy access to the system on mobile devices, which is something the old system was unable to do at speed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The site is currently running in its beta phase, which includes parallel running of both old and new apprenticeship search systems. This enables developers to continue to work closely with users to gather feedback to identify areas of improvement. As a result of user feedback, it is now possible to search by employer name, by apprenticeship level, and by partial postcode.
     </p>
     <p>
      So far, ‘Find an apprenticeship’ has supported over 85,000 candidates and has already processed around 210,000 applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      People using the old apprenticeship vacancy system will be redirected to the new site from May 2015, where they will be encouraged to create a new account. In the meantime, developers will continue to work closely with candidates and careers advisors to continuously improve the service.
