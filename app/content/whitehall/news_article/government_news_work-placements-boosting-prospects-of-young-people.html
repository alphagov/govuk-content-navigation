        Every week young people have started an average of 2,000 work-related placements as part of a drive to tackle youth unemployment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Youth Offer figures out today show that nearly 450,000 work experience and sector-based work academy pre-employment training placements have been started since 2012 by people aged between 18 and 24.
       </p>
       <p>
        Research published earlier this year revealed that each work experience placement saves the taxpayer around £150, and sector-based work academy, £100, with participants spending less time on benefits and more time in employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        With youth unemployment running at a near-record low of 5.8% and the number of young people claiming unemployment benefits dipping to levels not seen since the 1970s, the news is being welcomed as a further sign that efforts to extend opportunities to all are having a positive effect.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister for Employment Damian Hinds said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The Youth Offer benefits everybody, with businesses tapping in to fresh new talent, individuals reaping the reward of a regular wage, and concrete evidence for taxpayers that our plan to help young people into work is paying off.
        </p>
        <p>
         We’re making Britain a country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few and that includes our young people. We’ve made good progress, with youth unemployment down by over 300,000 since 2010.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         But there’s more to do, which is why we’re introducing the new Youth Obligation for 18 to 21-year-olds to help ensure that more young people are earning or learning and have the opportunity to progress in the labour market.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Specifically, the figures show that between April 2012 and May 2016 there were:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         325,840 starts to a work experience placement by young people across Great Britain
        </li>
        <li>
         121,040 starts to sector-based work academy training by young people in England and Scotland
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        These schemes will continue next year with more opportunities for placements for young people who are looking to launch their careers.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of our commitment to helping even more young people into work, the government has pledged to create 3 million apprenticeships by 2020 and recently launched the

        The work experience scheme consists of a placement with a host employer lasting up to 8 weeks. It provides young people with work-related experience and skills, and can be an important route into a job or an apprenticeship.
