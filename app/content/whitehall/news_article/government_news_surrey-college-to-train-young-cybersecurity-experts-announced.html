        Thousands of students in Surrey will be trained to become cyber security experts at a new college backed by technology giants, Schools Minister Lord Nash announced today (11 March 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Guildford university technical college (
        <abbr title="university technical college">
         UTC
        </abbr>
        ) will train up to 720 14- to 19-year-olds in cyber security, computer science and engineering, with students gaining valuable technical qualifications alongside studying core academic
        <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
         GCSEs
        </abbr>
        and A levels, such as English and maths.
       </p>
       <p>
        As society increasingly depends on digital services, the need for young people with the skills to design systems to protect information online, defend networks from attacks and prevent the loss of valuable data is growing.
       </p>
       <p>
        This demand has led to local employers backing the creation of a new
        <abbr title="university technical college">
         UTC
        </abbr>
        to address this shortfall in skills.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <abbr title="university technical college">
         UTC
        </abbr>
        will work with CGI, a global
        <abbr title="information technology">
         IT
        </abbr>
        firm, technology and engineering giants BAE Systems and Babcock International, industrial gases specialists Air Products, and other local employers to give students the best possible preparation for working life or further study. Royal Holloway, University of London, will also work with students as the university sponsor. The
        <abbr title="university technical college">

        </abbr>
        will also work with alongside Surrey county council, the Guildford Education Partnership and Guildford College.
       </p>
       <p>
        Surrey is one of the fastest-growing regions of the country and is the base for a number of high-profile technology employers, with many specialising in computer science and engineering.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister Lord Nash announced the college alongside a visit to Guildford College, which is helping to set up the
        <abbr title="university technical college">
         UTC
        </abbr>
        . 
He said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Equipping young people with the skills they need to secure great jobs is a key part of our plan for education - resulting in the lowest level on record of young people not in education, employment or training.
        </p>

         Guildford
         <abbr title="university technical college">
          UTC
         </abbr>
         will provide Surrey with generations of skilled cyber security, engineering and computer science experts. It is a perfect example of how we are placing technical education on a par with academic learning, while helping our thriving economy to flourish.

        Professor Paul Hogg, Vice Principal and Dean of Science at Royal Holloway, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         We are delighted to be a founding member of Surrey’s first university technical college and are looking forward to contributing our world-leading expertise in cyber security and computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
         In this digital age, governments, businesses and individuals are facing more cyber attacks than ever before, putting confidential information at risk. As the world celebrates the 800th anniversary of the sealing of Magna Carta in Runnymede, home to Royal Holloway, this year we are reminded of these modern threats to our freedom and personal liberty.
