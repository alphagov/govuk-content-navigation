      The figures for the first two terms of the 2012-to-2013 academic year show:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       139,750 fewer children missed 15% or more of school - equivalent to missing one-and-a-half years of a whole school career - compared to two years ago
      </li>
      <li>
       the number missing 15% or more of school is down from 450,330 in the 2010-to-2011 academic year to 310,580 in the 2012-to-2013 academic year
      </li>
      <li>
       65,540 fewer children missed 20% or more of school - equivalent to missing two years of a whole school career - compared to two years ago
      </li>
      <li>
       the number missing 20% or more of school is down from 199,370 in the 2010-to-2011 academic year to 133,830 in the 2012-to-2013 academic year

      The government has taken the following action to reduce persistent absence:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       in October 2011 the government reduced the definition of ‘persistent absence’ used to hold schools to account from 20% to 15%, in order to encourage schools to address the problem at an earlier stage
      </li>
      <li>
       in September 2012 fines for truancy were increased from £50 to £60, and from £100 to £120 if not paid within 28 days
      </li>
      <li>
       from last month the time limit for paying the penalties was reduced from 42 to 28 days
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       It is vital all children attend as much school as possible. That is why we have increased fines for truancy and encouraged schools to tackle persistent absence at an earlier stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that poor attendance can have a hugely damaging effect on a child’s education.

       than those who are persistently absent.

       Figures on overall and persistent absence in the 2011-to-2012 academic year were affected by unusually low levels of flu-like illness in schools along with the religious festival Eid falling out of term time. However, today’s figures confirm that the reductions in persistent absence shown in the 2011-to-2012 two-term figures have been maintained in the 2012-to-2013 academic year.
      </li>
      <li>
       Of pupils who miss between 10% and 20% of school, only 39% manage to achieve five A* to C
