        The figures for the first two terms of the 2012-to-2013 academic year show:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         139,750 fewer children missed 15% or more of school - equivalent to missing one-and-a-half years of a whole school career - compared to two years ago
        </li>
        <li>
         the number missing 15% or more of school is down from 450,330 in the 2010-to-2011 academic year to 310,580 in the 2012-to-2013 academic year
        </li>
        <li>
         65,540 fewer children missed 20% or more of school - equivalent to missing two years of a whole school career - compared to two years ago
        </li>
        <li>
         the number missing 20% or more of school is down from 199,370 in the 2010-to-2011 academic year to 133,830 in the 2012-to-2013 academic year

        The government has taken the following action to reduce persistent absence:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         in October 2011 the government reduced the definition of ‘persistent absence’ used to hold schools to account from 20% to 15%, in order to encourage schools to address the problem at an earlier stage
        </li>
        <li>
         in September 2012 fines for truancy were increased from £50 to £60, and from £100 to £120 if not paid within 28 days
        </li>
        <li>
         from last month the time limit for paying the penalties was reduced from 42 to 28 days
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         It is vital all children attend as much school as possible. That is why we have increased fines for truancy and encouraged schools to tackle persistent absence at an earlier stage.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that poor attendance can have a hugely damaging effect on a child’s education.

         Figures on overall and persistent absence in the 2011-to-2012 academic year were affected by unusually low levels of flu-like illness in schools along with the religious festival Eid falling out of term time. However, today’s figures confirm that the reductions in persistent absence shown in the 2011-to-2012 two-term figures have been maintained in the 2012-to-2013 academic year.

         Of pupils who miss between 10% and 20% of school, only 39% manage to achieve five A* to C
