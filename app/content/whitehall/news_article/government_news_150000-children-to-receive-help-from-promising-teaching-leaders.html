        Hundreds of thousands of children in challenging schools will receive extra help from specially trained teachers after Schools Minister David Laws announced £10 million to help develop school leaders of the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department for Education money will more than double the number of so-called ‘teaching leaders’ working in schools - from 766 currently to 1,706 by 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        The scheme - called Teaching Leaders - sees teachers already working in schools defined as challenging (see notes to editors) and with the potential to become outstanding leaders, such as heads of departments, put through a rigorous 2-year training programme which develops their skills and helps them get the most from pupils.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 125,000 children from disadvantaged backgrounds in 365 schools have already received assistance from the specially trained teachers since Teaching Leaders began in 2008 with government funding of almost £9 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        A 2-year study of the 118 teachers who started the programme in 2011 found the proportion of pupils achieving A* to C grades at
        <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
         GCSE
        </abbr>
        in teaching leader-led departments rose 7% between 2011 and 2013 - from 65% to 72% (source: Teaching Leaders).
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister David Laws will announce the funding at the Teaching Leaders 2011 cohort graduation ceremony tonight (Thursday 7 November).
       </p>
       <p>
        He said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         This programme has shown that outstanding leadership is crucial in getting the most from pupils.
        </p>
        <p>
         Teaching Leaders has helped schools identify their most promising teachers and turn them into the outstanding head teachers of tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         This new funding will also allow them to work with schools outside our main cities ensuring that wherever a child goes to school and whatever their background they will receive the best possible education.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Teachers from the 2011 group who have completed the programme have gone on to successful careers in education.
