      Hundreds of thousands of children in challenging schools will receive extra help from specially trained teachers after Schools Minister David Laws announced £10 million to help develop school leaders of the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department for Education money will more than double the number of so-called ‘teaching leaders’ working in schools - from 766 currently to 1,706 by 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      The scheme - called Teaching Leaders - sees teachers already working in schools defined as challenging (see notes to editors) and with the potential to become outstanding leaders, such as heads of departments, put through a rigorous 2-year training programme which develops their skills and helps them get the most from pupils.
     </p>
     <p>
      More than 125,000 children from disadvantaged backgrounds in 365 schools have already received assistance from the specially trained teachers since Teaching Leaders began in 2008 with government funding of almost £9 million.
     </p>
     <p>
      A 2-year study of the 118 teachers who started the programme in 2011 found the proportion of pupils achieving A* to C grades at
      <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
       GCSE
      </abbr>
      in teaching leader-led departments rose 7% between 2011 and 2013 - from 65% to 72% (source: Teaching Leaders).
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools Minister David Laws will announce the funding at the Teaching Leaders 2011 cohort graduation ceremony tonight (Thursday 7 November).
     </p>
     <p>
      He said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       This programme has shown that outstanding leadership is crucial in getting the most from pupils.
      </p>
      <p>
       Teaching Leaders has helped schools identify their most promising teachers and turn them into the outstanding head teachers of tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       This new funding will also allow them to work with schools outside our main cities ensuring that wherever a child goes to school and whatever their background they will receive the best possible education.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Teachers from the 2011 group who have completed the programme have gone on to successful careers in education.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of those staying in education in the UK:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       97% are still working in challenging schools
      </li>
      <li>
       56% have been promoted within challenging schools
      </li>
      <li>
       25% have been promoted to the senior leadership team
      </li>

       Teaching Leaders is an independent education charity which addresses educational disadvantage by developing school leaders.

       <abbr title="Absolute return for kids">

       and Future Leaders in 2008, Teaching Leaders now works with around 365 schools and 776 teachers.
      </li>
      <li>
       Teaching Leaders previously only worked with schools where more than 15% of children were on free school meals or under 40% achieved 5 or more A* to Cs at
       <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">

       Teaching Leaders has developed efficiency savings and economies of scale to ensure that it offers the best possible value for money:
       <ul>
        <li>
         teacher numbers: 930 new teachers (420 in 2014, 510 in 2015) for £9.9 million, the same cost as current funding for 720 teachers
        </li>
        <li>
         reduced cost per teacher: per teacher cost to the Department for Education will decrease by 27% from £13,081 to £9,516 over the course of the contract extension
