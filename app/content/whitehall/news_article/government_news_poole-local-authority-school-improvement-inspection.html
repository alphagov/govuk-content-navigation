        The aim of these inspections is to assess the contribution of local authorities to improving education in England. Inspectors examine the effectiveness of local authorities’ statutory duty to promote high standards in schools and among other providers so that children and young people achieve well and fulfil their potential.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ofsted carried out an inspection of the council’s arrangements for school improvement between 29 June and 3 July 2015. This was in response to serious concerns about the achievement and progress of pupils in primary and secondary schools, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, disabled pupils and pupils with special education needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Four schools were inspected as part of this exercise and telephone calls were made to a further 24 schools in the area. The schools inspected were all due for an inspection.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, inspectors held discussions with elected members, senior officers of Poole Borough Council, personnel responsible for supporting school improvement, partners delivering services brokered or commissioned by the authority, headteachers and governors from maintained schools and academies.

          The framework for the inspection of local authority arrangements for supporting school improvement.
         </a>
         The aim of local authority school improvement inspection is to assist local authorities in their duty to promote high standards and fulfilment of potential so that all children and young people benefit from at least a good education. The inspection framework acts as a powerful lever for improvement by helping to challenge inconsistencies. It enables Ofsted to report more rigorously on the contribution of local authorities to improving education in England. The inspection is not universal. Ofsted will normally inspect only where concerns about performance are apparent or where requested to do so by the Secretary of State.
