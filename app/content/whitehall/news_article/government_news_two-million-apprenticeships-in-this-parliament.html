      Two million people have started an apprenticeship, meaning the government has fulfilled its commitment to reach this milestone during the lifetime of this parliament.
     </p>
     <p>
      This important achievement highlights the continued success of apprenticeships since 2010 in giving people the skills they need to get on and in supporting businesses of all sizes to grow their talent.
     </p>
     <p>
      To mark the occasion, the Business Secretary met the two millionth apprentice, Paige McConville in Oxford.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paige took the Business Secretary on a tour of her employer, FMB Oxford, explaining how her apprenticeship with the firm is giving her the skills she needs to begin her career as an engineer. The Business Secretary also visited Abingdon and Witney College where Paige and her fellow apprentices study.
