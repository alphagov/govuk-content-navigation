      The tender process for 2015 recruitment is now closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Successful completion of early years initial teacher training will lead to the award of early years teacher status. Early years teacher status is the equivalent to qualified teacher status as the entry requirements to early years teacher training are the same as for primary teacher training.
     </p>
     <p>
      Early years teachers specialise in early childhood development and are trained to teach across the early years foundation stage (from birth to 5 years old). They must also understand how early education links to education beyond age 5 and into key stages 1 and 2 in school.
     </p>
     <p>
      School Direct (Early Years) creates more employer-led training, giving employers (schools and nurseries) the opportunity to recruit and select their own early years teacher trainees and engage in the design and delivery of early years
      <abbr title="initial teacher training">
       ITT
      </abbr>
      in partnership with accredited training providers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The programme enables schools and nurseries to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       influence how early years teachers are trained
      </li>
      <li>
       recruit the trainees that best meet their and their partnership’s needs, with the expectation that trainees will go on to work with the group of schools and nurseries where they trained
      </li>
      <li>
       decide which accredited training provider to work with and influence the way in which the training is delivered
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      This method of training is fully funded by National College for Teaching and Leadership and course fees of  £7,000 are paid for all trainees. Bursaries are also available: £9,000 for graduates with a first class degree and £4,000 for graduates with a 2:1.
