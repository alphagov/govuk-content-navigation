 <p class="description">
  An independent survey of employers in England shows that apprenticeships are helping businesses to boost loyalty inside and outside the workplace.

      The survey of 555 employers found that more than half (56%) of those surveyed who offer apprenticeships say apprentices stay in the business longer than other recruits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of these, 59% say this is because of the quality of the training provided and more than half believe it’s down to apprentices having the ability to learn and grow in the business from the bottom up.  In addition, one third of those who offer apprenticeships say apprentices are more committed to the business than other employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The survey also reveals that apprenticeships are not just helping employers to build a loyal, skilled workforce, but also enabling them to attract and win new business. Over three quarters (76%) of apprentice employers polled say they actively promote their apprenticeship credentials when pitching for new business or talking about their company, with just under 40% saying it is a key element of their pitch.
     </p>
     <p>
      The research also shows that taking on apprentices marks businesses out from the crowd, with a third saying that by taking on apprentices they have been able to differentiate themselves from their competitors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The study went on to reveal the impact that apprenticeships have on organisations’ wider supply chains.  A third of all the employers questioned said they would be more likely to choose a supplier or partner if they offered apprenticeships.  And 35% of apprentice employers say they actively advocate apprentice recruitment through their supply chain.

      Top 100 Apprenticeship Employer Blue Moon Creative agrees with the findings. Michael Taite, Managing Director at the branding and design agency said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       Apprenticeships have transformed our business, in a low risk way. Clients we want are more ready to talk to us, and people we might want to hire are queuing up. They have brought a fresh new dynamic into the company, making a big impression on clients and prompting us to review our approach to our processes, target markets and even the future of our business.
      </p>
     </blockquote>

      Redshift Research Ltd surveyed 555 decision makers in organisations with 2 or more staff in England. The fieldwork was conducted online between 4 March and 13 March 2015. Redshift Research Ltd is a member of the Market Research Society Company Partner Scheme.
     </p>
     <p>
      This independent research was conducted by Redshift to investigate how apprenticeships can drive loyalty for employers – both in terms of their employees, and also amongst existing and future clients.
