      Some of the UK’s top businesses will celebrate employing thousands of apprentices and pledge to take on more at a special reception in Downing Street today (18 January 2016) hosted by the Prime Minister and Business Secretary Sajid Javid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses and public sector organisations including Greene King and the Army will celebrate employing record numbers of apprentices, while firms including Deloitte and the Adecco Group will pledge to boost their numbers of apprentices. Top employers recognise the benefits apprenticeships bring to growing their businesses and providing opportunities for young people who want to work hard and get on.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Prime Minister will also announce that a new Apprenticeship Delivery Board will be established, bringing together some of the country’s leading business. With members from top employers including Channel 4, Barclays and Wates Construction, the board will encourage more businesses to develop quality apprenticeships. Members will act as apprenticeship champions within their sector, working with employers of all sizes to increase both the number of apprenticeship places on offer and the supply of talented candidates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Board will harness their experience and industry reputation to encourage others to follow their lead while also working to identify challenges that may be stopping employers getting involved with apprenticeships.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business Secretary Sajid Javid said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Three million more apprenticeships by 2020 means even more life changing opportunities for our young people. More than that, apprenticeships make sense for business. That’s why some of the country’s top business leaders are coming together to bang the drum for apprenticeships.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       We are putting employers at the heart of quality apprenticeships so that young people get the skills they need to succeed. Today we are celebrating everything that apprenticeships have to offer businesses and young people.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Chaired by the Prime Minister’s apprenticeship advisor Nadhim Zahawi MP and businessman and apprenticeship champion David Meller, the Apprenticeship Delivery Board will include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       David Abraham, Chief Executive of Channel 4
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>

      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Chair of the Apprenticeship Delivery Board, Nadhim Zahawi said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I’m proud that we’ve been able to put together such an exciting line up of top business leaders for the Apprenticeship Delivery Board. I look forward to working closely with them all, raising further awareness of the business benefits of apprenticeships and providing feedback on how to continually improve quality, as well as quantity.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       As ever more great British businesses get involved, and with the inclusion of higher and degree level apprenticeships, we can raise the status of apprenticeships while delivering 3 million starts by 2020; a target which provides us with an unmissable opportunity to change lives, boost skills and increase productivity in the UK economy.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Latest figures show that more people than ever before are participating in apprenticeships, with further employer commitments set to follow as the government continues to deliver its
