        The apprenticeship support and knowledge for schools (ASK) project will deliver apprenticeship and traineeship information to young people in years 10, 11, 12 and 13. This will ensure young people are aware of all the options available to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project is funded by the Skills Funding Agency and National Apprenticeship Service and will offer young people in the North, Midlands, London and the South the skills they need to get on in work.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will work with teachers, careers advisers, parents and governors, alongside other key partners, to support schools and ensure that they meet their statutory duties regarding the provision of impartial Information Advice and Guidance (IAG), specifically in relation to apprenticeships and traineeships.
       </p>
       <p>
        A core part of the ASK project includes identifying and recruiting 1,000 Apprenticeship Champions in schools across England to support the promotion of apprenticeships in their local areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Skills and Apprenticeships Minister Robert Halfon said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         I am committed to transforming this country into an apprenticeship nation. Initiatives like ASK and the 1,000 Apprenticeship Champions are essential to spreading the message that quality apprenticeships are a ladder of opportunity for all ages and all backgrounds.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        This network of teachers and careers advisers will positively promote apprenticeships in a variety of ways to inspire students, teachers, parents and governors, whilst actively encouraging students of all abilities to consider apprenticeships as a viable and successful route into a career. Apprenticeship Champions will also create opportunities for students to engage with employers and apprentice ambassadors.
