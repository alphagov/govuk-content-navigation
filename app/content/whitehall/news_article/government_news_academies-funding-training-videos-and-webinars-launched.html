      Following the success of last year’s training resources, the Education Funding Agency (EFA) has today released a series of
      <a href="https://registration.livegroup.co.uk/efa/" rel="external">
       short training videos
      </a>
      to help academies and free schools understand how their 2015 to 2016 funding allocation will be calculated.
     </p>
     <p>
      This online approach allows instant access to relevant information, which academies can view at a convenient time. It includes bite-size updates about different elements of schools funding. The videos are accompanied by powerpoint presentations which are also available to download for internal training purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The presentations cover:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the essentials of academy funding for the 2015 to 2016 academic year
      </li>
      <li>
       funding for free schools, UTCs and studio schools
      </li>
      <li>
       engaging with your schools forum
      </li>
      <li>
       the Education Services Grant - includes a worked example of the new tapered funding protection
      </li>
      <li>
       the Minimum Funding Guarantee - including capping and scaling
      </li>
      <li>
       funding for new openers
      </li>
      <li>
       funding outside your General Annual Grant
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We are also planning two interactive funding webinars which offer participants the opportunity to ask a panel of experts questions about next year’s funding:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       funding for academies: 2015 to 2016 academic year on Thursday 9 October at 2pm
      </li>
      <li>
       funding for free schools, UTCs and studio schools on Tuesday 14 October at 2pm
      </li>
     </ul>
