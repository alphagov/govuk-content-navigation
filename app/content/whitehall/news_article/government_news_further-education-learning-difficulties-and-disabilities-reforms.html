      The
      <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/childrenandfamilies.html" rel="external">
       Children and Families Bill
      </a>
      is currently before Parliament. The bill will bring radical changes to the learning difficulties and disabilities (
      <abbr title="learning difficulties and disabilities">
       LDD
      </abbr>
      ) system in England from September 2014. It will introduce important new responsibilities on further education colleges and approved independent specialist providers (
      <abbr title="independent specialist providers">
       ISP
      </abbr>
      ) as part of a new 0 to 25 special educational needs (
      <abbr title="special educational needs">
       SEN
      </abbr>
      ) system that will help provide young people with
      <abbr title="learning difficulties and disabilities">
       LDD
      </abbr>
      the support they need to realise their aspirations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Young people with
      <abbr title="learning difficulties and disabilities">
       LDD
      </abbr>
      and their families will be at the heart of the new system. It will provide them with greater choice and control over services and have an increased focus on supporting them to achieve the outcomes they want in life, including finding employment, obtaining accommodation and participating in society.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislation will:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       place a new duty on local authorities to involve colleges and
       <abbr title="independent specialist providers">
        ISPs
       </abbr>
       in their area - and beyond, where appropriate - when reviewing their special educational provision and developing their local offer of services
      </li>
      <li>
       enable colleges and
       <abbr title="independent specialist providers">
        ISPs
       </abbr>
       to request an assessment of education, health and care needs, by bringing a young person to the attention of their local authority
      </li>
      <li>
       introduce a new 0 to 25 education, health and care (
       <abbr title="education, health and care">
        EHC
       </abbr>
       ) plan, replacing the current systems of statements and learning difficulty assessments (
       <abbr title="learning difficulty assessments">
        LDAs
       </abbr>
       )
      </li>
      <li>
       allow young people to express a preference for a particular college or
       <abbr title="independent specialist providers">
        ISP
       </abbr>
       and require that institution to admit them, unless it was unsuitable for their education or that of others
      </li>
      <li>
       require local authorities to consult colleges and
       <abbr title="independent specialist providers">
        ISPs
       </abbr>
       about young people they would like to place with them, and send a copy of their
       <abbr title="education, health and care">
        EHC
       </abbr>
       plan to them
      </li>
      <li>
       place greater importance on the transition between school and further education, and on into adult life
      </li>
      <li>
       require colleges and
       <abbr title="independent specialist providers">
        ISPs
       </abbr>
       to have regard to the new 0 to 25
       <abbr title="special educational needs">
        SEN
       </abbr>
       Code of Practice
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      From 4 October to 9 December 2013, the Department for Education is consulting on drafts of the new 0 to 25
      <abbr title="special educational needs">
       SEN
      </abbr>
      Code of Practice and Regulations, and proposals for transferring young people from
      <abbr title="learning difficulty assessments">
       LDAs
      </abbr>
      to
      <abbr title="education, health and care">
       EHC
      </abbr>
      plans. All colleges and
      <abbr title="independent specialist providers">
       ISPs
      </abbr>
      are encouraged to read the

      and feed their views into the consultation to ensure we get these important documents right, and implement the reforms correctly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Effective preparation this academic year will be crucial to delivering a system from September 2014 that helps young people with
      <abbr title="learning difficulties and disabilities">
       LDD
      </abbr>
      achieve what they want from life, not just to cope with it. While local authorities are coordinating implementation in each area and will need to work with the further education (
      <abbr title="further education">
       FE
      </abbr>
      ) sector over the coming year, individual colleges and
      <abbr title="independent specialist providers">
       ISPs
      </abbr>
      should make sure they are prepared for implementation.
