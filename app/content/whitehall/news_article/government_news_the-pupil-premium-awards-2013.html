         The Pupil Premium Awards
        </a>
        celebrate schools that are using the pupil premium to make a real difference to the attainment of disadvantaged pupils.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year, the Deputy Prime Minister announced that there would be awards of up to £10,000 for schools that had done the most to boost the attainment of their disadvantaged pupils (defined as those entitled to free school meals, or pupils who have been in public care for six months or more). The 2013 Pupil Premium Awards will celebrate the successes of schools throughout England.
       </p>
       <p>
        The best schools in every English region will gain recognition, and regional winners will be invited to a reception in London, where the overall prizes will be announced. Judging will be by an independent panel of education experts.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are looking for schools that can demonstrate objectively how they have used the pupil premium to achieve a measurable advance in the attainment of their disadvantaged pupils.
       </p>
       <p>
        Closing date for entries is 17 April 2013, and the final will be held on 8 July 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2013 Pupil Premium Awards are being delivered in partnership with the Times Educational Supplement. Further details and applications are on the
        <a href="http://www.pupilpremiumawards.co.uk/" rel="external">
         Pupil Premium Awards website
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Any school in England can nominate themselves, but information on the pupil premium pages of the
        <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/pupilsupport/premium" rel="external">
         Department’s website
        </a>
        will help you to decide whether or not you would like to apply.
