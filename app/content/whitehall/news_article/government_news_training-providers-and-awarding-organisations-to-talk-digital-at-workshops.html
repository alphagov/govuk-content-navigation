     <p>
      Training providers and awarding organisations will get the opportunity to share their knowledge and understanding of digital skills qualifications at a series of workshops being held by the Skills Funding Agency (SFA).
     </p>
     <p>
      The workshops, taking place in June, form part of a review of publicly-funded digital skills qualifications, led by the SFA.
     </p>
     <p>
      The SFA will work with the sector to review existing qualifications and look at the future design requirements for digital skills qualifications. This will help the SFA to make sure that any new qualifications approved for public funding continue to meet the needs of employers, learners and providers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The SFA will publish the outcome of the review later this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Details of the available workshops are below:
