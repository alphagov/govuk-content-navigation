        Parents of children and young adults who are disabled or seriously ill will be able to apply for a share of the £27.3 million Family Fund, the Government announced today as it continues its commitment for two years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Family Fund, the UK’s largest grant giving charity, is designed to make life easier for low-income families with disabled and seriously ill children and young people. The money can be used for days out, garden play equipment, computers, toys and kitchen appliances like dishwashers and washing machines.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fund helped more than 50,000 families in England last year, from a total of £27 million. The fund is now in its 40th year.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Edward Timpson, Minister for Children and Families, said:
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Families with disabled or seriously ill children will be able to apply for items and activities that will make a real difference to their family lives. I’m delighted that in these difficult times we’re able to commit to this significant fund for at least another two years.
       </p>
       <p>
        We’re also changing the law to make life better for parents who have children with special educational needs. We want to ensure they have the opportunities and support they need to realise their full potential.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Family Fund helps families of children with some of the most complex needs - including children and young people with cerebral palsy, attention deficit disorder, autism and sickle cell anaemia. An independent review has found that the Family Fund is the best way to give support to low-income families raising disabled or seriously ill children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ian Black, Chair of Trustees for the Family Fund, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         Family Fund supported the independent review and the opportunity to gain valuable feedback and evaluation of our work. The comprehensive outcome gave a significant endorsement of our model.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         We are pleased to receive continued funding from the Department for Education and look forward to delivering essential support to thousands of families living on the lowest of incomes raising disabled and seriously ill children, in this our 40th year.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
