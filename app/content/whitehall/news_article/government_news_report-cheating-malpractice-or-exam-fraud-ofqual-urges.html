     <p>
      With summer GCSE, AS and A level exams under way, Ofqual is today (20 May) reminding teachers, schools, parents and students about the importance of reporting any evidence or suspicions of cheating, malpractice or exam fraud.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees of exam boards, schools, colleges or training centres should first raise any concerns with their employer if they can. More information is provided at
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/whistleblowing">
       gov.uk/whistleblowing
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      If a concern is reported to us and relates to a school, college or training centre, we will ask the appropriate awarding organisation to investigate. If a concern relates to an awarding organisation itself, then we will investigate the matter.
     </p>
     <p>
      A spokesperson for Ofqual said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       It’s our job to maintain standards and confidence in qualifications. Cheating, malpractice or exam fraud undermines the hard work of students, teachers and schools. If anyone has concerns about qualifications we regulate then we would urge them to contact the appropriate exam board or us straight away. All reports are taken very seriously. If you see it or suspect it, report it.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      We have produced
      <a href="https://uk.pinterest.com/ofqual/posters-postcards-report-cheating-malpractice-or-e/" rel="external">
       a series of posters and postcards
      </a>
      that schools may wish to use during the summer series to promote reporting.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOTES TO EDITORS:
     </p>
     <p>
      Before reporting a suspected incidence of malpractice, those with concerns should read Ofqual’s whistleblowing policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cheating can be reported via
      <a href="https://www.surveygizmo.co.uk/s3/1068584/c16e1cb59b3d" rel="external">
       the form on Ofqual’s website
      </a>
      . Whistleblowing disclosures can also be made through the Ofqual helpline 0300 303 3346 between 9am and 5pm Monday to Friday and by email to
      <a href="mailto:public.enquiries@ofqual.gov.uk">
