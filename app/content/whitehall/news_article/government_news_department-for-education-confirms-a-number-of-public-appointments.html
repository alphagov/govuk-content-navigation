        The appointments and the extensions were agreed in accordance with the Code of Practice issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) and were made on merit; political activity played no part in the decision-making process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations and the code of practice, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared), and other information, to be made public.

          STRB considers aspects of teachers’ pay and conditions for just under half a million teachers and school leaders in England and Wales. STRB was established under the terms of the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Act 1991 (as replaced by the Education Act 2002). It is a statutory independent advisory body. Its function is to consider matters referred to it by the Secretary of State for Education in relation to the remuneration, professional duties or working time of school teachers and to report to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State.

          QCDA was set up to advise ministers on the curriculum, develop and deliver national curriculum assessments, develop qualifications and to support schools and colleges in their delivery of examinations. Following the Secretary of State’s announcement on 27 May 2010, the Education Bill currently before Parliament provides for the abolition of the QCDA. Subject to the will of Parliament, the QCDA is expected to close by March 2012. Its remit has been reduced in the run up to closure with only essential functions continuing until they can be transferred to the Department or to the new executive agency, the Standards and Testing Agency.

          National College is currently a company limited by guarantee and an executive Non-Departmental Public Body (NDPB). The National College’s aim is to provide a driving force for excellence in school leadership, through training and development opportunities; and through disseminating good practice. As part of the government’s arms length body reform programme the status of the National College will be changed to that of an executive agency of the Department for Education focusing on school leadership.

          Partnerships for Schools delivers capital investment in schools for the government. Its responsibilities cover all secondary schools, primary schools and new free schools. Its future role in capital procurement and delivery, along with that of central government and local authorities, is within scope of the Capital Review. The Review has been published and ministers will be responding shortly.
