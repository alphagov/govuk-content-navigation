      The awards now in their 13th year, showcase many success stories and the benefits of apprenticeships across England.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses and apprentices fought off tough competition by demonstrating how employers are growing their own talent with apprenticeships and how apprentices have made a significant contribution to their workplaces.
The top apprentices and employers winners and highly commended entries were announced at an awards ceremony held at the Holiday Inn, Taunton.

      Skills and Apprenticeships Minister Robert Halfon said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Apprenticeships are a ladder of opportunity, giving young people and adults the chance they deserve to get on and fulfil their potential.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Congratulations to everyone that has taken part in the National Apprenticeship Awards so far and the winners representing the South West. They have demonstrated just how much businesses and learners can gain from an apprenticeship.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Sue Husband, director, National Apprenticeship Service, added:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The National Apprenticeship Awards enable talented apprentices and committed employers to receive the recognition they truly deserve. Our awards not only celebrate the achievements of apprentices and businesses alike but they also encourage others to get involved in apprenticeships.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Today’s winners are the best of the best in the South West. I congratulate each and every one of them on their success and for those heading to the national finals, the very best of luck.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
