        The challenge, now in its fourth year, tests apprentices on their teambuilding, leadership, logistical and communications abilities in a series of work-related challenges.
       </p>
       <p>
        It encourages teams to develop new skills, conduct activity to benefit their local communities as well as raise the profile of their employers and apprenticeships.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each team comprises 9 apprentices, and can be made up from a single employer, a group of small businesses, an industry sector, supply chain or training provider.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year, over 110 teams and 1000 apprentices entered the Brathay Apprentice Challenge. Teams:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         raised £30,000 for charity
        </li>
        <li>
         conducted more than 360 school visits to talk about the benefits of apprenticeships
        </li>
        <li>
         delivered 60 community projects
        </li>
        <li>
         recruited over 50 new businesses to offer apprenticeships
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        PepsiCo were crowned the apprentice team of the year 2014 at Brathay Trust’s headquarters on the shore of Windermere in June.  QinetiQ were named second place, with British Airways and e2v Technologies finishing joint third. Past winners also include manufacturer Innovia Films in 2013 and defence firm Cobham in 2012.

        Godfrey Owen, Chief Executive of, Brathay Trust, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         The challenge provides apprentices with the opportunity to develop a huge range of skills with previous competitors reporting improved teambuilding, leadership, logistical and communications skills. Employers reported that they saw improved skills among the competing apprentices and increased local profile of their organisations through positive PR and corporate social responsibility opportunities. We look forward to both apprentices and employers reaping these benefits in the 2015 search for the apprentice team of the year.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Sue Husband, Director at the National Apprenticeship Service, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p class="last-child">
         The quality of work coming from the teams that take part in the challenge shows employers and the wider community the impressive work apprentices can achieve. It is important that employers recognise opportunities like the Brathay Apprentice Challenge as a chance to let their great apprentices shine.
        </p>
