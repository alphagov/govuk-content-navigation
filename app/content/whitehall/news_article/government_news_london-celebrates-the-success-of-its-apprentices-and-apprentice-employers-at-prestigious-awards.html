        The National Apprenticeship Awards, now in their 12th year, celebrate the success of the country’s most exceptional apprentices and apprenticeship employers. The awards challenge top apprenticeship employers and apprentices across England to come forward and show how apprenticeships have made a real difference to their organisation and careers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The London winners and highly commended entries were announced at a high profile awards ceremony on October 14th organised by the National Apprenticeship Service, which was held at City Hall.
       </p>
       <p>
        Skills Minister Nick Boles said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         A big congratulations to all the apprentices and employers in London who impressed the judges today. From local businesses to large household names, from intermediate to degree apprentices, all of today’s winners truly deserve this recognition.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         The success of each winner reminds us of how crucial apprenticeships are in supporting our workforce, our businesses and our economy. This is why we are committed to delivering 3 million apprenticeships by 2020.
        </p>

        <p>

        <p class="last-child">

       <p>
        Sue Husband, Director of the National Apprenticeship Service, said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Apprenticeships deliver for businesses, individuals and the economy. They enable people to gain the skills and knowledge they need to succeed, in some cases up to degree level, while working and earning. And for businesses, hiring apprentices is a productive and effective way for them to grow their own talent by developing a motivated, skilled and qualified workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
         The National Apprenticeship Awards enable talented apprentices and committed employers to receive the recognition they richly deserve. They not only help celebrate the achievements of apprentices and businesses, allowing them to gain the credit for investing in their own futures, but they drive up quality and encourage others to get involved.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         Today’s winners are the best of the best in London and I would like to congratulate them on their achievements. They deserve to be rewarded for their efforts. There has never been a better time to become an apprentice or employ one.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Following the regional ceremonies, the winners from each category in all 11 areas of England will have their entries sent for national judging, and 3 from each category will be selected as national finalists.
       </p>
       <p>
        The apprenticeship employer entries that were judged to be the very best of the best will have the additional honour of featuring in the Top 100 Apprenticeship Employers list.
       </p>
       <p>
