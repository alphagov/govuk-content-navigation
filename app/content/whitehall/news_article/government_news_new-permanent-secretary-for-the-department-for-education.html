      Jonathan Slater has been appointed as the new Permanent Secretary for the Department for Education. This follows the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-permanent-secretary-for-the-department-of-health">
       announcement that Chris Wormald will move from Education to become Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Jonathan, who is currently Director General Economic and Domestic Affairs Secretariat at the Cabinet Office, was chosen following an open competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      The appointment has been made by the Prime Minister in agreement with the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, and Education Secretary Nicky Morgan. Jonathan will take up his post at the Department for Education on Tuesday 3 May.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Cabinet Secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       I will be sorry to see Jonathan leaving the Cabinet Office so soon. But he has a real passion for education and helping all children to fulfil their potential. I know he will do a great job at the Department for Education helping to support and deliver the government’s reform agenda. I wish him every success in building on the great work of Chris Wormald.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I’m delighted that Jonathan will be the new Permanent Secretary at the Department for Education.
      </p>
      <p>
       As well as his experience at the Cabinet Office, Jonathan will bring invaluable expertise in leading major delivery programmes at both the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Defence, as well as his background in local government. He is particularly well-placed to lead the department to deliver the next phase of our reforms to education and children’s social care, and I look forward to working closely with him.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       It has been a pleasure to work with Chris Wormald during his tenure as Permanent Secretary here. I wish him all the best as he moves to the Department of Health.‎
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Commenting on his new role, Jonathan Slater said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       It’s a tremendous honour to have been given the opportunity to lead this wonderful department, supporting Nicky Morgan and her ministerial teams in their efforts to give all of our children the very best education, protection and opportunity possible. And to drive a really ambitious equalities agenda right across government.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       I’ve had a great time in the Cabinet Office, working with many brilliant people doing important work. But I can’t wait to get stuck in to my new role, and to start meeting my new talented and committed
