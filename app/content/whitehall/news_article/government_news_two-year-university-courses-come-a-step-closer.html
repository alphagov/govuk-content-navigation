      The government has today, Friday 24 February,
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/amendments-tabled-ahead-of-lords-report-stage">
       tabled amendments
      </a>
      to the
      <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/highereducationandresearch.html" rel="external">
       Higher Education and Research Bill
      </a>
      to encourage more flexible learning and increased choice for students.
     </p>
     <p>
      These include a key amendment to enable universities to offer more accelerated courses, including 2-year courses, where content is condensed into a shorter period.
     </p>
     <p>
      This amendment would enable a higher annual fee limit to be set for accelerated courses, subject to Parliamentary approval. This amendment responds to evidence which shows that inflexible fee structures are seen as a major barrier to the availability of accelerated courses, with many universities unable to deliver their traditional 3-year courses in 2 years because of the existing limit on annual fees.
     </p>
     <p>
      This delivers on a manifesto commitment to encourage universities to offer more 2-year courses and extends the opportunity to study at England’s world-class universities to even more people.
     </p>
     <p>
      The government intends to consult on the detail of how to deliver higher annual fee limits for accelerated courses ahead of tabling secondary legislation. The proposals will include clear measures to ensure the limit would only apply to accelerated courses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other important amendments to the bill tabled today include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       an amendment which will help students to store up academic credits and to switch institution more easily
      </li>
      <li>
       an amendment which will place a requirement on the new sector regulator - the Office for Students - to have regard to institutional autonomy in everything that it does
      </li>
      <li>
       amendments that will guarantee that the standards against which providers are assessed are determined by the higher education sector
      </li>
      <li>
       an amendment that enshrines in law for the first time the Haldane Principle, which dictates that decisions on individual proposals should be reviewed and made by experts in their fields; this means with that all governments will, in the future, need to have regard to the Haldane Principle when making a grant or giving directions to UK Research and Innovation - the government’s single strategic research and innovation funding body
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Speaking at the Universities UK conference in London, Jo Johnson, the Minister for Universities and Science, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Change is long overdue and this bill gives us the chance to introduce new ways of learning. Students are crying out for more flexible courses that enable them to get into and back into work more quickly, and courses that equip them with the skills that the modern workplace needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I absolutely recognise that for many students the classic 3-year model will remain the preferred option but that cannot be the only option. That is why we have tabled amendments that give real flexibility in learning.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       These changes will not mean any compromise in quality, or an increase in overall degree costs for students. The tuition fees for a student taking an accelerated degree will never be more, in total, than those for the same degree over a longer time period. It is also likely that students will end up paying less overall because they will have fewer years of maintenance costs and a real chance of entering the workforce more quickly.
      </p>
