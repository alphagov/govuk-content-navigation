        Success rates for 2012 to 2013 and provisional further education and skills data for the full 2013 to 2014 academic year have now been

         published

        .
       </p>

        Commenting on the national statistics: Keith Smith, Interim Skills Funding Agency Chief Executive said:  “The Agency continues to focus on working with employers to create more high quality apprenticeship opportunities, including targeting investment and effort where it will have the greatest impact and deliver the greatest returns, particularly in creating opportunities for younger people (aged 16 to 24) and advanced level and higher apprenticeships.  Today’s figures show good progress towards our policy aims.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Moving forward, reforms will make apprenticeships more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers, to further improve the quality, put employers in the driving seat and simplify the system.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “It is pleasing to see statistics published on Traineeships in the SFR for the first time, showing more than 10,000 starts, which demonstrates that in their first year, they are off to a good start.  It is also great to see learners investing in their future skills with just over 57,000 learners taking up 24+ Advanced Learning Loans.”
