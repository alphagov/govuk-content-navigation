      The figures show:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       There were an estimated 5,740 permanent exclusions from primary, secondary and all special schools in 2009/10.
      </li>
      <li>
       There were 279,260 fixed period exclusions from state funded secondary schools, 37,210 fixed period exclusions from primary schools and 14,910 fixed period exclusions from special schools.
      </li>
      <li>
       The average length of a fixed period exclusion in state funded secondary schools was 2.5 days, for primary schools the average length of a fixed period exclusion was 2.1 days.
      </li>
      <li>
       The permanent exclusion rate for boys was approximately four times higher than that for girls. The fixed period exclusion rate for boys was almost three times higher than that for girls.
      </li>
      <li>
       Pupils with SEN with statements are around eight times more likely to be permanently excluded than those pupils with no SEN.
      </li>
      <li>
       Children who are eligible for free school meals are around four times more likely to receive a permanent exclusion and three times more likely to receive a fixed period exclusion than children who are not eligible for free school meals.
      </li>
      <li>
       Nearly 900 children are suspended from school for abuse and assault every school day.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Schools Minister Nick Gibb said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       With thousands of pupils being excluded for persistent disruption and violent or abusive behaviour we remain concerned that weak discipline remains a significant problem in too many of our schools and classrooms. Tackling poor behaviour and raising academic standards are key priorities for the Coalition Government. We will back head teachers in excluding persistently disruptive pupils, which is why we are removing barriers which limit their authority.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       We have already introduced a series measures to put head teachers and teachers back in control of the classroom - including clearer guidance and increased search powers. Through the Education Bill we are introducing further measures to strengthen teacher authority and support schools in maintaining good behaviour.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       We are also concerned that pupils who are excluded from school not only receive a good education but are also helped to tackle their behaviour problems. This is why we are reforming the alternative education they receive to raise its quality. It is unacceptable that only 1.4 per cent pupils in alternative provision achieve five good GCSEs including English and Maths. We are also trialling a new approach to permanent exclusion and making Free School status available to alternative provision providers in order to open up the sector and raise standards.
      </p>
