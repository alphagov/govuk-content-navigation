      More young people than ever before are choosing an apprenticeship. To support this demand, we are pleased to announce an additional £25m for colleges and training providers to deliver 16 to 18 apprenticeships.
     </p>
     <p>
      This funding will support the growth of apprenticeships and demonstrates the government’s commitment to achieving 3 million high quality apprenticeship starts by 2020.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to this 16 to 18 growth, we also awarded £67.8m growth on 19+ apprenticeships and £11m for 19+ traineeships in December 2015. This investment means that the government has committed over £100m in growth in the 2015 to 2016 funding year.
     </p>
     <p>
      In prioritising funding for apprenticeships we are currently unable to award any additional funding for 16 to 18 traineeships. We will review this again at performance management point 2.
