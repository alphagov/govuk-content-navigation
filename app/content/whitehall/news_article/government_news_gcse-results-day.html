        School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said:

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The hard work and determination of hundreds of thousands of 16-year-olds will be rewarded today as they collect their
         <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
          GCSE
         </abbr>
         results; qualifications that are the gateway to the next stage of their education.
        </p>
        <p>
         We want to make our country a place where there is no limit on anyone’s ambition or what they can achieve - that’s why we are working to ensure there are even more high-quality schools in every part of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         And I am pleased to see that there are more
         <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
          GCSEs
         </abbr>
         being taken in the

          core academic subjects
         </a>
         , those that give students a wider range of opportunities.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         And for those 17-year-olds who have struggled to achieve good grades in maths, we are seeing 4,000 more successful retakes of those exams, delivering better prospects for every one of those young people.‎

         subjects by students aged 16 have increased by 6.4% compared to 2015. The government is committed to making Britain the best place in the world to study

         computer science, from 35,414 in 2015 to 62,454 in 2016. The number of girls studying computer science has more than doubled since last year

         <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
          GCSE

         is the highest since 2002. This shows that schools and students value the contribution that

         as a result of the government’s early entry rule, where only the first exam entry counts towards

          GCSEs
         </abbr>
         continues to drop. Entries are down by 28% year on year, so more students are being entered when they have been fully prepared for their examinations

         <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">
          GCSEs
         </abbr>
         thanks to colleges and schools across England. 51,200 maths exams sat by students aged 17 and over were graded A* to C - up from 30,000 in 2012. For English, the equivalent figures were 34,500 in 2016, up from 21,100 in 2012
