      Dr Roger Morgan, Children’s Rights Director for England, has this week published his
      <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/childrens-views-digest" rel="external">
       final report
      </a>
      – a summary of the views and experiences of children and young people he has worked to represent for over a decade.
     </p>
     <p>
      The report is intended to be a ‘digest’ in one place of what children and young people think about a range of rights, welfare and safeguarding issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      The responsibilities of Children’s Rights Director will, as of today [01 April 2014], form part of the work of the office of the Children’s Commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the past 13 years Roger Morgan and his team have worked to champion the views of children and young people living away from home, or in care, asking them about social care, and how they are looked after in children’s homes, boarding schools, residential special schools, further education colleges or residential family centres.
     </p>
     <p>
      Throughout his tenure as Children’s Rights Director, Roger Morgan has published over 150 children’s views reports, from speaking with around 20,000 children and young people.
     </p>
     <p>
      All of the reports are made up exclusively of what children and young people think about their care, providing their unadulterated feedback directly to government, policy-makers, and professionals who work with young people.
     </p>
     <p>
      The team also carried out individual advice and case work, helping over 5000 children and young people to have a greater say in their care placements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Roger Morgan, Children’s Rights Director for England, says:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       It has been my pleasure and privilege to have held the role of Children’s Rights Director, working with many exceptional children and young people over the last 13 years and ensuring their voices are heard. I wish the Children’s Commissioner every success in taking on this important work.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       I hope that our legacy for all who work with children and young people will be to ensure what so many children have told me over the years – that they want to be heard, but most importantly, be taken as seriously as any other age group.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The Office of the Children’s Rights Director has also been instrumental in securing several key policy changes for children and young people in care, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       greater frequency of required social worker visits
      </li>
      <li>
       the right for children to see a social worker alone where safe to do so and most recently,
      </li>
      <li>
       the right in law for all children in care to trigger a review of their own care plans
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Debbie Jones, Ofsted’s National Director for Social Care says:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       It is so vital that policy concerning children and young people and services that are developed for them, are informed and shaped by their views and experiences.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Roger Morgan and his team have helped many young people to be heard for the past decade, and I’d like to thank him for this invaluable work. Ofsted remains committed to reflecting the important opinions and experiences of children in all that we do.
      </p>
