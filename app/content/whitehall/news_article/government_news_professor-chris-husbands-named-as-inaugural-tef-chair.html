      Professor Chris Husbands, Vice-Chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University has been named as the first Chair of the Teaching Excellence Framework (
      <abbr title="Teaching Excellence Framework">
       TEF
      </abbr>
      ) panel following a recruitment process led by government.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Husbands will head up the assessment panel that will make decisions on university ratings in the second and third year of the programme.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Teaching Excellence Framework has been introduced to ensure excellent teaching and student job prospects are at the heart of higher education. The framework, which for the first time places the significance of teaching on a par with research, will put clear information into the hands of students so they know where teaching is best and what benefits they can expect to gain from their courses.
     </p>
     <p>
      The expert assessment panel will award each higher education provider a clearly understandable rating of ‘Outstanding’, ‘Excellent’ or ‘Meets Expectations’, based on evidence and a number of metrics.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Chris Husbands, Vice-Chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I am delighted to have been appointed as chair of the government’s Teaching Excellence Framework panel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <abbr title="Teaching Excellence Framework">
        TEF
       </abbr>
       aims to recognise and reward excellent learning and teaching in higher education. It will build on the existing high standards of learning and teaching in universities, and I hope that it provides positive outcomes for all students, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds. I’ve always been passionate about the importance of high quality teaching, and look forward to working with government and the sector to secure the benefits which
       <abbr title="Teaching Excellence Framework">
        TEF
       </abbr>
       can bring.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       UK higher education has a global reputation for excellence, and I’m looking forward to working as part of the panel to help shape and guide the assessment process at this important time in the evolution of higher education.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Universities and Science Minister Jo Johnson said;
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I would like to welcome Professor Husbands to this vital role. By taking into account important measures such as student satisfaction and graduate employment rates, the Teaching Excellence Framework will give students clear information about where they can achieve the best outcomes and for the first time, place teaching quality on a par with research.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Professor Husbands has senior leadership experience from a varied range of higher education providers, in addition to direct knowledge of teaching in other sectors and a distinguished research background. In his new role he will help to build on the existing high standards we expect of providers, stretching the best and rightly encouraging those with variable quality to improve.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Nicola Dandridge, the Chief Executive of UUK, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       The
       <abbr title="Teaching Excellence Framework">
        TEF
       </abbr>
       represents a complex exercise, and Professor Husbands’ outstanding leadership and academic experience will help ensure that both the sector and students have confidence in the
       <abbr title="Teaching Excellence Framework">
        TEF
       </abbr>
       process and judgements.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Professor Husbands has already begun his role and will be in the position for a period of 2 years.
