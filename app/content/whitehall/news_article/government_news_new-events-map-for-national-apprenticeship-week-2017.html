      National Apprenticeship Week runs from 6 to 10 March and will demonstrate the many benefits that apprenticeships can bring. The week will also aim to raise awareness and encourage more employers to take on apprentices and individuals to choose an apprenticeship as a ladder of opportunity to a great career.
     </p>
     <p>
      All over the country employers, schools, colleges and training organisations support the week by holding events and hosting activities to promote apprenticeship opportunities.
     </p>
     <p>
      We are using our
      <a href="https://nawevents.co.uk/" rel="external">
       online events map
      </a>
      to track all of this exciting activity so you can see what is happening near you. If you are running an event for National Apprenticeship Week, please submit information using our
      <a href="https://nawevents.co.uk/events_submission/submission_form" rel="external">
       online form
      </a>
      so that we can include it on the map and let everyone else know what you are doing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hosted by the National Apprenticeship Service, the events map has been developed by a team that includes two software development apprentices, Luke and Ian. They also had help from two IT graduates, Bhavik and Zulfu, who worked alongside the apprentices on this exciting project.
