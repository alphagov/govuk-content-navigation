      Proposals to create a school system that works for everyone, not just the privileged few, by creating more good school places are
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/schools-that-work-for-everyone">
       currently being consulted on
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The proposals include plans to remove the ‘faith cap’ on new free schools on the basis that it has not been as effective as hoped in promoting diversity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Evidence shows that in all new minority faith designated free schools there is a single dominant ethnic group constituting at least 80% of the pupils on average.
     </p>
     <p>
      This compares to Catholic faith schools where the largest ethnic group is under 75%. It should be noted that no Catholic free schools have been opened since the cap was introduced, with the cap often being cited as a barrier to new Catholic free schools being opened.
     </p>
     <p>
      After being made aware of concerns raised to the UK Statistics Authority with the wording of the consultation, where this evidence is referred to, we have today made a clarification to the document and added an additional data table, to remove any uncertainty or confusion.
     </p>
     <p>
      This change has been made as part of the government’s commitment to transparency.
