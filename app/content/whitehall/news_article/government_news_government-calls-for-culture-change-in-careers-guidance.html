      Skills Minister Matthew Hancock today called for all schools and colleges to follow the example of the best and provide inspiring careers advice to young people.
     </p>
     <p>
      He also said it was vital that employers worked with schools and colleges to ensure all young people received high-quality careers advice - with employers taking centre stage in inspiring young people to get on in life.
     </p>
     <p>
      His comments came on the day his
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/careers-inspiration-vision-statement">
       ‘Inspiration vision’
      </a>
      and the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/careers-guidance-action-plan">
       government response
      </a>
      to 2 reports on careers were published.

       ‘Going in the right direction?’
      </a>
      was published today (10 September 2013) and the National Careers Council report
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creating-a-culture-change-in-careers-provision-an-aspirational-nation">
       ‘An aspirational nation’
      </a>
      was published in June.
     </p>
     <p>
      Matthew Hancock’s ‘Inspiration vision’ sets the tone for the government’s position on careers guidance: all schools and colleges should do as the best do, put young people in touch with the world of work to inspire them about their futures and help them make fully informed decisions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The government gave schools and colleges the responsibility to provide independent and impartial careers advice because heads and teachers know their pupils best. The previous system was replaced as it was often costly, patchy and of poor quality. Critics include Alan Milburn, formerly the chair of the Panel on Fair Access to the Professions, who found very little support for the previous system (see notes to editors).
     </p>
     <p>
      In today’s response to the
      <abbr title="Office for Standards in Education">
       Ofsted
      </abbr>
      and National Careers Council reports, the government is setting out how it will help schools and colleges carry out this duty.
     </p>
     <p>
      The government will:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       revise the guidance it provides to schools and colleges. Due out in the autumn, the new guidance will be even clearer about what constitutes excellent careers guidance. It will ensure schools are focused on having high aspirations for their pupils
      </li>
      <li>
       improve the information about where pupils go on to after they finish their
       <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">
        GCSEs
       </abbr>
       and A levels (destination measures). It will give schools and colleges more information to assess the effectiveness of their careers guidance
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Matthew Hancock said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Today we are announcing new action to improve careers guidance by holding schools to account.
      </p>
      <p>
       People with fulfilling careers are the ones who can really show young people what it is like to succeed in the world of work. That is why I want more employers involved in providing high-quality careers advice to the future workforce.
      </p>
      <p>
       We gave schools and colleges the responsibility for securing good careers advice for their pupils because they know them best.
       <abbr title="Office for Standards in Education">
        Ofsted
       </abbr>
       highlighted excellent careers advice already being provided by schools, but I want all schools to do as the best do - inspiring young people, providing work experience and putting them in touch with employers.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       There is also a challenge to us all: to respond to the world as it changes, to inspire, to motivate, to encourage and to create a skilled workforce to compete in the global race.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The
      <a href="https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/Pages/Home.aspx" rel="external">
       National Careers Service
      </a>
      will also be improved to give young people a greater understanding of the full range of options available to them. It will use its local networks to bring employers, schools, charities and social enterprises together. The government has maintained its budget for 2015 so it can continue to provide online, telephone and face-to-face support for adults of all ages. Its activities will be extended to improve the careers resources that are available to schools, young people and parents.
     </p>
     <p>
      The government’s measures respond to the recommendations made by
      <abbr title="Office for Standards in Education">
       Ofsted
      </abbr>
      and the National Careers Council reports.
      <abbr title="Office for Standards in Education">
       Ofsted
      </abbr>
      pointed to good examples of careers guidance provided schools and colleges in its report. It made recommendations for the government, schools, local authorities, employers and the National Careers Service so all schools can provide high-quality careers guidance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The National Careers Council report called for a culture change in careers provision for young people. It also called for an improvement of the National Careers Service, so it makes young people aware of the full range of options available to them.
     </p>

      The government response and ‘Inspiration vision’ have been published on GOV.UK.
