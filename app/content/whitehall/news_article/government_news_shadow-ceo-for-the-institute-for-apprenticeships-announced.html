      The Department for Education has today (26 September 2016) announced that Peter Lauener is being appointed, with immediate effect, as the Shadow Chief Executive for the Institute for Apprenticeships. The Institute for Apprenticeships is a new independent body led by employers that will lie at the heart of ensuring the quality of apprenticeships in England.
     </p>
     <p>
      Peter will fulfil this role on a part-time basis (2 days a week) alongside his responsibilities as Chief Executive of the Skills Funding Agency and Education Funding Agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Peter will bring extensive experience from across the skills sector at this key time in the establishment of the Institute for Apprenticeships. This includes considerable experience at senior levels in setting up and running organisations, including as Chief Executive of the Young People’s Learning Agency which he set up in 2010, working closely with his chair and the appointed board. He also has a strong career history in the development of apprenticeships and has worked closely with employers, colleges and training providers in a number of different roles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Peter will work closely with Antony Jenkins, the Shadow Chair for the institute. Antony is the former Group Chief Executive of Barclays and the current Chair of Business in the community. He will be supported by Michael Keoghan, currently Director of Further Education at

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      A permanent Chief Executive will be appointed in 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Institute for Apprenticeships will act as the ultimate decision maker on approving apprenticeship standards and assessment plans to ensure they are high quality so that employees get the skills they need to succeed from the apprenticeship system.
