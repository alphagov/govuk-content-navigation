        Mr Green will play a key role in the government’s education reforms, in particular:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         promoting the benefits of the academies and free schools programmes among school leaders, local authorities and parents
        </li>
        <li>
         recruiting high-quality academy sponsors
        </li>
        <li>
         encouraging school-to-school collaboration and support
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Frank Green has enjoyed a highly successful 40-year career in education. From starting as a science teacher he rose to become a headteacher of 2 schools and then chief executive of a successful academy chain. He is a National Leader of Education and a director of the Independent Academies Association. He was appointed
        <abbr title="Commander of the Order of the British Empire">
         CBE
        </abbr>
        this summer for services to education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools Minister Lord Nash said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Frank Green has already been a brilliant servant to education in this country. He has been an inspiring classroom teacher and a brilliant head. Most recently he has led one of the most successful academy chains, with a track record of turning round underperforming schools. His is an enviable record.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         His experience and skill mean he will be an excellent and highly credible schools commissioner, challenging schools and local authorities to raise standards for all children.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Mr Green is currently chief executive of Leigh Academies Trust, a role he has held for the last 5 years. The trust oversees 7 schools, all based in the Dartford area of Kent. The trust’s 3 secondary schools, all non-selective in a highly selective area, converted when each had fewer than 30% of pupils achieving 5 or more GCSEs at A* to C including English and maths. This year, the 3 schools’ average was 67%. He has also advised a number of other academy trusts. Leigh Technology Academy was rated outstanding by Ofsted in 2009. The leadership and management in all inspections of his schools has been described as “outstanding” and “exceptional and enterprising”.
       </p>
       <p>
        He said:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I am delighted to be taking up this vital role at such an exciting and ambitious time for education in England. I want to champion all schools, not just academies and free schools, and look forward to seeing standards continue to rise across the board.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am looking forward to working at a national level to drive improvement across the system.
        </p>
        <p class="last-child">
         I have direct experience of transforming schools that are underperforming and also maintaining that improvement once achieved, so I understand the challenges many schools face in order to perform at the highest level for their pupils.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The schools commissioner post was created in the 2006 Education and Inspections Act. Mr Green’s term is 2 years.
