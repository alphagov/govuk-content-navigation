     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       The Prime Minister has made clear that this government will focus on making Britain a country that works for everybody - not just the privileged few. For me, that starts with education.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was tremendous to see first-hand the fantastic work Walsall College is doing to bridge the gap between education and industry and get more young people on to the career ladder.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       This is a place where people’s lives and prospects are ‎transformed for the better, and where there is a real drive to push standards ever higher.

     <blockquote>
      <p>
       We are honoured that Justine chose to visit the college and give us the opportunity to showcase our work in the sector. The college prides itself on delivering world-class vocational training that equips students with the skills and knowledge employers are looking for. Our main aim is to give students a head start in the workplace or prepare them for university, and in doing so, create growth in our economy.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       Over the last 4 years, we have also grown our apprenticeship provision by 74% and are working with over 500 employers to support their business objectives, making us one of the biggest providers of apprenticeships for 16- to 18-year-olds in the West Midlands.
