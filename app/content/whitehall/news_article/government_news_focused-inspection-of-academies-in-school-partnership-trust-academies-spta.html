      Ofsted has today (10 March 2016) published the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-partnership-trust-academies-spta-inspection-outcome-letter">
       outcome letter of the focused inspection of academies in the

       (School Partnership Trust Academies)
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The inspections are part of a concerted programme of action by Ofsted to establish the effectiveness of a multi-academy trust (
      <abbr title="multi-academy trust">
       MAT
      </abbr>
      ) in supporting and challenging academy schools within individual chains.
     </p>
     <p>
      Along with the outcome letter for
      <abbr title="School Partnership Trust Academies">
       SPTA
      </abbr>
      , Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw has today written a letter to the Secretary of State for Education raising his concerns about the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/focused-inspections-of-academies-in-multi-academy-trusts">
       findings from the focused inspections of a sample of academies in 7 of the largest MATs
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The letter details the poor oversight, challenge and support provided by the trusts to ensure that pupils in all their academies receive a good quality of education.

      The
      <abbr title="School Partnership Trust Academies">

      <li>
       Her Majesty’s Inspectors (HMI) carried out inspections of 6 academies as part of the focused inspection between 23 and 27 November 2015. Two of these inspections were full inspections and 4 were monitoring visits. The academies were all due for an inspection by the end of this academic year.

        Secretary of State for Education wrote to Ofsted on 23 January 2015 clarifying the arrangements for the focused inspection of academies
       </a>
       . In the first week, Ofsted inspects a number of the trust’s academies. Inspectors also hold telephone conversations with other academy principals. In the following week inspectors now visit multi-academy trust central offices and hold discussions with staff from the trust. They consider a range of other evidence alongside the results from the focused inspections.
