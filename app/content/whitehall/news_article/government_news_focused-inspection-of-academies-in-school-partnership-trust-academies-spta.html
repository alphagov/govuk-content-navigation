        Ofsted has today (10 March 2016) published the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-partnership-trust-academies-spta-inspection-outcome-letter">
         outcome letter of the focused inspection of academies in the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The inspections are part of a concerted programme of action by Ofsted to establish the effectiveness of a multi-academy trust (
        <abbr title="multi-academy trust">
         MAT
        </abbr>
        ) in supporting and challenging academy schools within individual chains.

        Along with the outcome letter for
        <abbr title="School Partnership Trust Academies">
         SPTA
        </abbr>
        , Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw has today written a letter to the Secretary of State for Education raising his concerns about the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/focused-inspections-of-academies-in-multi-academy-trusts">
         findings from the focused inspections of a sample of academies in 7 of the largest MATs
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The letter details the poor oversight, challenge and support provided by the trusts to ensure that pupils in all their academies receive a good quality of education.

         Her Majesty’s Inspectors (HMI) carried out inspections of 6 academies as part of the focused inspection between 23 and 27 November 2015. Two of these inspections were full inspections and 4 were monitoring visits. The academies were all due for an inspection by the end of this academic year.

         . In the first week, Ofsted inspects a number of the trust’s academies. Inspectors also hold telephone conversations with other academy principals. In the following week inspectors now visit multi-academy trust central offices and hold discussions with staff from the trust. They consider a range of other evidence alongside the results from the focused inspections.
