      Delegations from around the world will head to Scotland as the

      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      The annual conference, which took place in Berlin this week, brings together education ministers and teaching unions from high-performing and rapidly improving education systems all over the world.

     <p>
      Minister of State for Schools in England Nick Gibb, who attended the
      <a href="http://www.istp2016.org/" rel="external">
       2016 summit
      </a>
      this week, said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       It is a great honour for the
       <abbr title="United Kingdom">
        UK
       </abbr>
       to host the International Summit on the Teaching Profession in 2017. Since the first summit took place in the
       <abbr title="United States of America">
        USA
       </abbr>
       in 2011, it has established itself as a valuable forum for countries to discuss education reform.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       The 2016 summit has heard from countries around the world introducing reforms to raise the status of the teaching profession and secure higher academic standards in schools. It demonstrates the importance of our own education reform programme in England, ensuring our place amongst the highest performing nations internationally.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Angela Constance, Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning in Scotland, who also attended this week’s summit said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       I am delighted that Scotland is hosting this prestigious event on behalf of the
       <abbr title="United Kingdom">
        UK
       </abbr>
       .
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       The 2017 summit will be an excellent opportunity to showcase Scottish education on the global stage and promote culture and tourism at the same time. This follows on from the success of the International Congress for School Effectiveness and Improvement in Glasgow in January and Scotland hosting delegations from education systems across the world keen to learn about our education system and the reforms we have delivered through Curriculum for Excellence.
