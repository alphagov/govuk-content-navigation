      Skills Minister Nick Boles will today (18 November 2014) announce government plans to open up the traineeships programme to more young people to help them prepare for apprenticeships and other work.
     </p>
     <p>
      He will also announce measures to publish data and improve how providers are funded, to build on the programme’s successful start after 10,000 young people participated last year. The changes follow a
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/traineeships-funding-reform-in-england">
       government consultation
      </a>
      on ways to ensure traineeships have the best results for young people.
     </p>
     <p>
      The joint
      <abbr title="Department for Education">
       DfE
      </abbr>
      and
      <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">
       BIS
      </abbr>
      proposals received positive responses from a wide range of those involved in the programme including training providers, students and employers. Respondents overwhelmingly supported wider eligibility for traineeships, backed changes to improve data on trainees’ outcomes and welcomed a more consistent approach to funding across the 16 to 24 age group.
     </p>
     <p>
      Speaking at the Association of Colleges (
      <abbr title="Association of Colleges">
       AoC
      </abbr>
      ) annual conference, Skills Minister Nick Boles will say:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       More than 10,000 young people have already started a traineeship with firms like BT and Barclays - and they are proving a fantastic opportunity. But there is much more potential, so I want to see training providers and employers offer many more places.
      </p>
      <p class="last-child">
       The changes I am announcing today are based on feedback directly from those involved in the programme. I am confident it will be even easier to create top quality traineeships, focused on getting young people into apprenticeships and other jobs.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Traineeships form an integral part of the government’s long-term economic plan to tackle youth unemployment. Backed by leading employers including BT, Virgin Media and Siemens, they give young people the skills and experience that employers look for when recruiting.
     </p>
     <p>
      Damian Brown, BT Ready to Work Programme Lead said:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">
       BT welcomes the announcement from the minister that traineeships are being opened up to more young people. Traineeships give a great opportunity for 16 to 24 year olds to get into work and by reducing the eligibility criteria, employers can ensure many more young people can access these opportunities.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      As well as gaining widespread support from employers of all sizes, the
      <abbr title="Trades Union Congress">
       TUC
      </abbr>
      and
      <abbr title="Confederation of British Industry">
       CBI
      </abbr>
      came together in August 2014 to mark the first anniversary of traineeships by announcing their joint support for the scheme.

       <ul>
        <li>
         19 to 24 year olds who already have the equivalent of a full Level 2 qualification will become eligible – in line current eligibility for 16 to 18 year olds (from January 2015)
        </li>
        <li>
         better use of destination and progression data for traineeships, based on improved definitions of positive outcomes for trainees
