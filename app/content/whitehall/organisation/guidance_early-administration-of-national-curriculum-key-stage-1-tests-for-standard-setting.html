         The Standards and Testing Agency (STA) has notified all schools selected to administer the key stage 1 (KS1) tests early of their selection. Selected schools have a statutory duty to participate in the early administration of the tests.
        </p>
        <p>
         Information about early administration of the KS1 tests was published in the
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/2016-key-stage-1-assessment-and-reporting-arrangements-ara">
          2016 Assessment and reporting arrangements
         </a>
         (ARA).
        </p>
        <p>
         Each school has been selected to administer a KS1 test for a single subject from the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          English reading
         </li>
         <li>
          English grammar, punctuation and spelling
         </li>
         <li>
          mathematics
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         The information schools provide is vitally important to ensure valid and reliable results for all pupils nationally.
        </p>
        <p>
         The results from the early administration of the tests will be used to set the expected standard for each of the KS1 tests, and to produce the raw-score to scaled-score conversion tables.
        </p>

        <div class="call-to-action">
         <p>
          The tests must be administered between Monday 11 and Friday 22 April 2016. Scripts must be marked and ready for collection by Tuesday 26 April.
         </p>
        </div>
        <p>
         However, we can arrange collection of marked scripts at any point during the administration window, up to and including Tuesday 26 April 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
         Schools should administer the relevant test to their full cohort of KS1 pupils. The test must then be marked by the school and marked scripts returned to STA as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         STA will publish KS1 test administration guidance for all schools in March. Schools selected to participate in early administration should use this information to inform their planning. The guidance includes how to ensure tests are stored securely and administered appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
         Further details about the early administration arrangements will be published shortly. This information will cover:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          when schools can expect to receive test materials
         </li>
         <li>
          what stationery schools will receive
         </li>
         <li>
          how marked scripts should be sent back to STA
         </li>
         <li>
          information about how to record absent pupils and those working below the standard assessed by the test
         </li>
         <li>
          guidance specifically relating to the testing, marking and teacher assessment processes

        <p>
         Pupils’ results will only be used to inform standard setting. They will not be used for accountability purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Teacher assessment outcomes for all pupils will be submitted together by 13 June 2016. When making their judgements, schools will need to take account of the fact that pupils took the test in 1 subject early. This may mean that since taking the test pupils have acquired additional knowledge and skills that will inform their final teacher assessment judgement.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will return pupils’ scripts to schools once they have been scanned so that they can be used to inform teacher assessment. Scripts will be returned to schools by 6 June 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you have any questions regarding the early administration of the KS1 tests, please contact the national curriculum assessments helpline or email STA.
