       Your child might be able to get free school meals if you get any of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Income Support
       </li>
       <li>
        income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
       </li>
       <li>
        income-related Employment and Support Allowance
       </li>
       <li>
        support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999
       </li>
       <li>
        the guaranteed element of Pension Credit
       </li>
       <li>
        Child Tax Credit (provided you’re not also entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross income of no more than £16,190)
       </li>
       <li>
        Working Tax Credit run-on - paid for 4 weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit
       </li>
       <li>
        Universal Credit
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Children who get paid these benefits directly, instead of through a parent or guardian, can also get free school meals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your child might also get free school meals if you get any of these benefits and your child is both:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        younger than the
        <a href="/school-attendance-absence/">
         compulsory age for starting school
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        in full-time education
       </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="infant-free-school-meals-in-england">
       Infant free school meals in England
      </h2>
      <p>
       Your child will be able to get free school meals if they’re in:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        reception class
       </li>
       <li>
        year 1
       </li>
       <li>
        year 2
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Tell your local authority if you also get any of the above benefits. Your child’s school can get extra funding if you do.
