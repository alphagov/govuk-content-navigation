      Coulsdon C of E Primary School in Surrey is part of the Coulsdon Cluster, a group of 7 primary and 2 secondary schools which meets twice a term to plan inter-school competitions and share good practice.
The sports coach employed by the cluster shares expertise with all the schools, and the primary pupils enjoy a much wider range of activities than would usually be available, through their use of the secondary schools’ sports resources.

      New College Leicester shares its specialist sports facilities with some leading community sport clubs. These clubs have in turn provided expert coaches to run satellite sports clubs at the college’s 6 partner primary schools, to encourage younger children to continue participating in sport long after they’ve left school.
