     <p>
      Step Up is a programme in South Tyneside for young people who aren’t in education, employment or training (NEET) or who are at risk of becoming NEET. The project helps them with employment and training.
     </p>
     <p>
      Step Up is operated by an organisation called Springboard. It works with training organisations and other partners, supporting agencies and employers in the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      By April 2013, of 325 young people who had taken part in Step Up:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       81% of them achieved a qualification
      </li>
      <li>
       50% moved on to further education or employment
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="working-in-the-community">

     </h2>
     <p>
      Transitional and mentoring officers work in the community to recruit young people onto the programme. They’re the first point of contact for participants, assessing their needs, identifying their career objectives and referring them to further training and related activities. They continue their support and mentoring role throughout the training.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Step Up programme has benefited from effective employer engagement. Local employers have agreed to recruit and train young people, with 25 employers providing placements for Step Up participants by April 2013.
