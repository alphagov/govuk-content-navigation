      Improving performance
     </h2>
     <p>
      At Harefield Academy in West London, a support network of 45 staff and 20 senior students act as mentors to help sports students define individual goals and plan ways to achieve them. The results have been dramatic, with national championship titles, European and international sporting success.

      Increasing sports activities
     </h2>
     <p>
      St Joseph’s Catholic Primary school in Hampshire employs a sports games organiser to run tournaments, leagues and festivals with a hub of other local schools, to increase pupils’ opportunities for competitive sport. The school has also built strong links with local sports clubs to give pupils the widest possible choice of team and individual sports. This has helped St Joseph’s to win a bid to provide a new multi-purpose, all-weather pitch for both the school and local community.
