      Blessed Trinity Roman Catholic School (Burnley) for 11- to 16-year-olds, was formed in 2006 as an amalgamation of a boy’s school and a girl’s school which ran on a split site until 2010. Pupils at the school come from both privileged and deprived backgrounds. Approximately one-fifth of pupils are eligible for the pupil premium, and the vast majority come from white British backgrounds. In 2011 Ofsted rated the school ‘inadequate’ overall and in behaviour, but in 2013, the school was rated as ‘requires improvement’ with behaviour rated as ‘good’.

     <h2 id="on-call-room">

     </h2>
     <p>
      The school uses an on-call room where pupils who are removed from the classroom can go to reflect upon their behaviour and cool down from the incident. An on-call member of staff collects the pupil from the classroom and takes them to the room. If a pupil is frequently removed to the on-call room, the school will provide tailored support to help them manage their behaviour.

     <p>
      Before a pupil is removed to the on-call room, the school has a procedure in the behaviour policy for all staff to follow when dealing with poor behaviour in the classroom:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the pupil receives an informal warning (this is to allow a teacher to use their skills to diffuse a situation and foster a positive relationship)
      </li>
      <li>
       the pupil receives a formal warning - no sanction
       <ul>
        <li>
         stage 1: still no sanction but the behaviour is recorded on the School Information Management System (SIMS)
        </li>
        <li>
         stage 2: the pupil receives a detention
        </li>
        <li>
         stage 3: the pupil is removed from the class into another class
        </li>
        <li>
         stage 4: the pupil is removed to the on-call room for continued misbehaviour in the other classroom, or in the first instance for serious misbehaviour
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="individual-behaviour-support">
      Individual behaviour support

     <p>
      The school has a nurture room to support pupils who struggle to manage their own behaviour. The purpose of the room is to foster:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       engagement
      </li>
      <li>
       belonging
      </li>
      <li>
       self-regulation
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      and to develop pupils’ social skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      A range of interventions away from the nurture room is also in place including, catch-up learning such as reading support. This was introduced because the school found that poor behaviour often stemmed from class disengagement due to a lack of basic reading and writing skills.
