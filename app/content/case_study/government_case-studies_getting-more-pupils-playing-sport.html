      Godolphin and Latymer School in London surveyed its girls to find out what sports activities would appeal to them. As a result of the survey, it now offers pilates, dance and zumba, as well as hockey, netball and rowing. The school encourages the girls to take part in extra-curricular squads and clubs through assembly presentations by club members and extra-curricular fairs. The school has also reviewed its kit policy to allow the girls to wear a range of warm clothing during the winter months.
