      Saint Benedict Academy (Derby) is a Catholic school for 11- to 18-year-olds, which also welcomes pupils from other faiths. The school takes pupils from across the city, resulting in a diverse socioeconomic and ethnic mix. In November 2012, the school was rated by Ofsted as good in behaviour.
     </p>
     <h2 id="turnaround-centre">
      Turnaround centre
     </h2>
     <p>
      The school has a turnaround centre that offers a modified curriculum and behaviour management support to pupils who can’t learn in mainstream school, frequently due to persistent disruptive behaviour. A pupil will usually spend a minimum of 6 weeks in the turnaround centre, depending on their need, with the aim of being reintegrated into mainstream school.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pupils in the turnaround centre are monitored closely to ensure the intervention meets their specific needs. There is a daily written log, parents are contacted every week, and there are 3- and 6-week reviews to evaluate progress. When the pupil returns to the main school they are accompanied by a learning support assistant who supports their move back into mainstream school.
     </p>
     <h2 id="c-system">
      ‘C’ system
     </h2>
     <p>
      The school also has a range of measures to tackle behaviour before it escalates into persistent poor behaviour. The school created the ‘C’ system to help staff consistently tackle behaviour:
     </p>
     <table>
      <tbody>
       <tr>
        <td>
         C1 means chance
        </td>
        <td>
         This gives the pupil a chance to stop the behaviour and, if they do, nothing is recorded
        </td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td>
         C2 means choice
        </td>
        <td>
         This means that the pupil chose to continue behaving badly and will receive a 30-minute detention during which the pupil and teacher will talk about the behaviour
        </td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td>
         C3 means consequence
        </td>
        <td>
         This means that the pupil has continued to misbehave and will be removed from the classroom to the isolation room. The pupil will receive a 30-minute detention and a Friday after-school detention
        </td>
       </tr>
      </tbody>
