      Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (
      <abbr title="Gypsy, Roma and Traveller">
       GRT

      <abbr title="Gypsy, Roma and Traveller">
       GRT
      </abbr>
      pupils achieve very well at school.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are many complex and interwoven factors that may influence the educational attainment of
      <abbr title="Gypsy, Roma and Traveller">
       GRT
      </abbr>
      pupils. Schools and local authorities can make a big difference to their life chances through:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       clear high expectations of all pupils, regardless of their background
      </li>
      <li>
       an inclusive culture that welcomes all communities
      </li>
      <li>
       strong engagement from parents

      Kingsholm Primary School (Gloucestershire)
     </h2>
     <p>
      Compared to reception year, this primary school has a much higher proportion of pupils of Traveller ethnicity and pupils joining the school later. The school reports that most
      <abbr title="Gypsy, Roma and Traveller">
       GRT
      </abbr>
      pupils have good attendance and attainment. Ofsted has rated Kingsholm Primary as outstanding.

      Ofsted recognises the school’s successful promotion of good relations between pupils from different communities and its refusal to tolerate discrimination of any kind. Initiatives designed to prevent discrimination include whole school assemblies to raise awareness of
      <abbr title="Gypsy, Roma and Traveller">

      culture.

     <h3 id="high-expectations-of-attendance">
      High expectations of attendance

     <p>
      Kingsholm Primary also has rigorous attendance systems, with the same high expectations for all pupils’ attendance, regardless of their ethnicity. There is a named attendance officer who works closely with
      <abbr title="Gypsy, Roma and Traveller">
       GRT
      </abbr>
      parents to ensure they understand the possible sanctions for any unauthorised absence. The attendance officer follows up any cases of lateness or absence on the same day.

      The school has good relations with its Showmen families, working closely with them to plan any periods of travelling for work, helping to minimise disruption to pupils’ education. For example, the school encourages Showmen to try to arrange their work so that pupils can attend the school at the start of term and to dual register their children at 2 or more schools while they travel.

      Shirley Community Nursery and Primary School (Cambridgeshire)

      Around half of all children at Shirley Primary are from minority ethnic backgrounds, with around 90 children of
      <abbr title="Gypsy, Roma and Traveller">
       GRT
      </abbr>
      ethnicity. Ofsted’s most recent report notes that Traveller children are making good progress at the school. Ofsted has rated Shirley Primary as good.

     <h3 id="identifying-the-concerns">
      Identifying the concerns

     <p>
      The school works with
      <abbr title="Gypsy, Roma and Traveller">
       GRT
      </abbr>
      pupils and parents to identify any concerns. This includes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       pupil voice interviews with
       <abbr title="Gypsy, Roma and Traveller">
        GRT
       </abbr>
       children about their attitudes to school and homework to inform the school’s understanding of any issues they experience
      </li>
      <li>
       consultations with parents, including a questionnaire to capture their main concerns and assess the level of interest in future events for parents
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3 id="parental-engagement">
      Parental engagement
     </h3>
     <p>
      The school identified that
      <abbr title="Gypsy, Roma and Traveller">
       GRT
      </abbr>
      parents lacked confidence in their knowledge of what their children are learning in maths and phonics, and how they might support these areas at home. The school’s interventions included:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a jointly run session with the on-site children’s centre for
       <abbr title="Gypsy, Roma and Traveller">
        GRT
       </abbr>
       parents, invited personally by school staff (one such session, recognising that
       <abbr title="Gypsy, Roma and Traveller">
        GRT
       </abbr>
       communities have an oral story culture, supported parents to understand how to construct a written story, and gave them a ‘story sack’ resource to support their children’s learning at home)
      </li>
      <li>
       support for children beginning school, including introductory sessions for parents and children on the main areas of learning that will be covered at school, and expectations of good attendance and behaviour
      </li>
      <li>
       regular tailored update letters to
       <abbr title="Gypsy, Roma and Traveller">
        GRT
       </abbr>
       parents on their children’s progress in reception class
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The school reports higher levels of usage of the children’s centre, improved parental engagement and a smoother transition from early years provision to primary school.

       GRT
      </abbr>
      parents were more likely than other communities to opt for home education after primary school, the school put into place additional support for their transition to secondary school. Their actions included:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a designated teaching assistant and home liaison officer from Cambridgeshire’s Traveller Education Team working with parents to identify and alleviate common concerns, such as explaining the secondary school’s anti-bullying policies to the parents
      </li>
      <li>
       year 5 and 6 pupils spending a day at a local secondary school to carry out an enterprise project, looking at what they will learn in secondary school and how it will improve their employment prospects.
      </li>
      <li>
       parent-and-child visits to the secondary school to familiarise themselves with the building and staff
