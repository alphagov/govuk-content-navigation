      Our Lady’s RC Primary School in Manchester has made

       PE
      </abbr>
      teacher training and support a priority. Staff inset days are used for training and planning, and teachers are sent on relevant courses.  They are also observed and supported by a specialist teacher and this has helped to increase the teachers’ confidence and enjoyment when taking
      <abbr title="physical education">
       PE
      </abbr>
      lessons.
     </p>
     <p>
      The school has received many accolades for its outstanding sports teaching, including being selected to work with the Association of Physical Education and the Youth School Trust to demonstrate high-quality

      St Brigid’s Catholic Primary School in Birmingham hires a coaching company to run regular 6-week training programmes in
      <abbr title="physical education">
       PE
      </abbr>
      . The coaches work alongside class teachers during
      <abbr title="physical education">
       PE
      </abbr>
      lessons to give teachers the skills and confidence to then take the classes themselves. This type of specialised training will have a lasting, long-term impact on sport and

      teaching at the school.
