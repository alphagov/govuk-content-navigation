      The Matchfit project is run by a team based at Bradford College. It’s funded by the Skills Funding Agency and the European Social Fund via the Skills Enhancement Fund operated by Calderdale College.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bradford College ran a successful joint Skills Show local programme and Matchfit Grand Finals day at Bradford College in March 2013. The Skills Show provides information about education, skills and apprenticeships in an inspiring, interactive environment at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham and at local events.
     </p>
     <p>
      Matchfit promotes competitions to motivate people of all ages in the Yorkshire and Humber region to improve and demonstrate their skills. By October 2013 there had been over 68 competitions within 5 subject sector areas with over 1140 entrants from 16 organisations. After competing at a regional level with Matchfit, students can apply to enter national level competitions run by World Skills UK.

      Involving manufacturers, suppliers and employers
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Grand Finals day involved manufacturers, suppliers and employers working with Bradford College staff and students. Schools were informed, Jobcentres received posters and every young person not in education, employment or training received an invitation by post. Students led on the activities while staff provided support and career guidance. Large local employers offered employment advice.
