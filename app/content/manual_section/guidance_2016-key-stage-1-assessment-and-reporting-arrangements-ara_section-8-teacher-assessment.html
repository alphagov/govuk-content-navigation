         interim teacher assessment frameworks
        </a>
        are to support teachers in making robust and accurate judgements for pupils at the end of
        <abbr title="key stage1">
         KS1
        </abbr>
        in 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        The interim teacher assessment frameworks are for 2015 to 2016 only. The
        <abbr title="Department for Education">
         DfE
        </abbr>
        is evaluating options for future years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The interim frameworks set out the standard(s) a pupil will be assessed against at the end of the key stage for reading, writing, mathematics and science. Teachers must refer to the interim teacher assessment frameworks to fulfill their statutory duty to report at the end of the key stage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The frameworks contain a number of ‘pupil can’ statements such as, ‘The pupil can write a narrative about their own and others’ experiences (real and fictional), after discussion with the teacher using sentences with different forms in their writing (statements, questions, exclamations and commands)’.
       </p>
       <p>
        The evidence must show that the pupil demonstrates attainment of all the ‘pupil can’ statements within the standard they have been awarded. Teachers must be confident the pupil meets the ‘pupil can’ statements in the preceding standards but there is no requirement to produce specific evidence for all of them. It is likely that the pupil’s work for the standard they have been awarded will also evidence the ‘pupil can’ statements of the preceding standard(s).

        8.3 Pupils working below the standard of the national curriculum tests
       </h2>
       <p>
        The review of statutory assessment arrangements for pupils working below the standard of national curriculum tests is an independent review chaired by Diane Rochford. The review was established by the Minister for Schools in July 2015 to consider the best way to ensure that pupils who have not completed the relevant key stage programme of study, and are therefore working below the standard of statutory testing arrangements, have the opportunity to demonstrate attainment and progress at primary school.In December 2015 the review group published an

        In December 2015 the review group published an
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rochford-review-interim-recommendations">
         interim solution
        </a>
        .
The interim solution follows the same principles as the interim teacher assessment frameworks. It creates additional pre-key stage standards for the frameworks which each contain a number of positive ‘pupil can’ statements. These statements reflect the attainment of pupils who have not yet completed the relevant programme of study but have reached the chronological age that requires a statutory assessment outcome to be reported. The

         interim pre-key stage standards

        are to be used by
teachers to report a statutory assessment outcome for working below standard of tests, but above the P scales, including SEND and non-SEND pupils.
