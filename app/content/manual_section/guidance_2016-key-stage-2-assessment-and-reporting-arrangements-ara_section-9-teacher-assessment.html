        Following the removal of teacher assessment levels, the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/interim-frameworks-for-teacher-assessment-at-the-end-of-key-stage-2">
         interim teacher assessment frameworks
        </a>
        are to support teachers in making robust and accurate judgements for pupils at the end of
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        in 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        The interim teacher assessment frameworks are for 2015 to 2016 only. The
        <abbr title="Department for Education">
         DfE
        </abbr>
        is evaluating options for future years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The interim frameworks set out the standard(s) a child will be assessed against at the end of the key stage for reading, writing, mathematics and science. Teachers must refer to the frameworks to fulfil their statutory duty to report at the end of the key stage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The frameworks contain a number of ‘pupil can’ statements such as, ‘the pupil can write for a range of purposes and audiences (including writing a short story) creating atmosphere, and integrating dialogue to convey character and advance the action’. The evidence must show that the pupil demonstrates attainment of all the ‘pupil can’ statements within the standard they have been awarded. Teachers must be confident the pupil meets the ‘pupil can’ statements in the preceding standards but there is no requirement to produce specific evidence for all of them. It is likely that the pupil’s work for the standard they have been awarded will also evidence the ‘pupil can’ statements of the preceding standard(s).

        <li>
         working towards the expected standard

       </ul>
       <p>
        Pupils will be grouped into 4 categories for accountability; the 3 categories above plus an additional category for those pupils that do not meet the ‘working towards’ standard.

        The
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rochford-review-interim-recommendations">
         review of statutory assessment arrangements for pupils working below the standard of
national curriculum tests
        </a>
        is an independent review chaired by Diane Rochford. The review was
established by the Minister for Schools in July 2015 to consider the best way to ensure that
pupils who have not completed the relevant key stage programme of study, and are therefore
working below the standard of statutory testing arrangements, have the opportunity to
demonstrate attainment and progress at primary school.
       </p>
       <p>
        In December 2015 the review group published an
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rochford-review-interim-recommendations">
         interim solution
        </a>
        which follows
the same principles as the interim teacher assessment frameworks. It creates additional pre-key
stage standards for the frameworks which each contain a number of positive ‘pupil can’
statements. These statements reflect the attainment of pupils who have not yet completed the
relevant programme of study but have reached the chronological age that requires a statutory
assessment outcome to be reported.
