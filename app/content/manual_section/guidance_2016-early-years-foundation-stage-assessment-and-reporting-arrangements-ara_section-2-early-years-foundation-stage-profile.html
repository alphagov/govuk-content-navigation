        The
        <abbr title="early years foundation stage">
         EYFS
        </abbr>
        profile is an inclusive assessment. It can capture a wide range of pupils’ learning and development outcomes. Despite this, practitioners might find the observation and assessment of some pupils particularly challenging.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a pupil is given an outcome of ‘emerging’, it might not provide the full picture about that pupil’s learning and development at the end of the
        <abbr title="early years foundation stage">
         EYFS
        </abbr>
        . In these cases, extra information should be considered alongside
        <abbr title="early years foundation stage">
         EYFS
        </abbr>
        profile judgements. This will ensure that conversations with key stage 1 staff are meaningful and help the pupil to make a successful transition.
       </p>
       <p>
        There may be cases where it is not appropriate to make a judgement against an assessment scale, for instance if the pupil has recently arrived from abroad. In these cases, practitioners must use ‘A’ (for no assessment) when they submit the data to their
        <abbr title="local authority">

        <abbr title="early years foundation stage">
         EYFS

        <abbr title="early years foundation stage">
         EYFS
        </abbr>
        provision beyond the end of the academic year in which he or she reaches the age of 5. Providers should take care to make sure this decision does not prejudice the pupil’s personal, social and emotional development.
       </p>
       <p>
        In these exceptional cases, assessment should continue throughout the pupil’s time within
        <abbr title="early years foundation stage">

        provision. An
        <abbr title="early years foundation stage">
         EYFS
        </abbr>
        profile should be completed only once at the end of the year before the pupil moves into key stage 1.The setting should discuss their intention to defer the pupil’s statutory assessment with their
