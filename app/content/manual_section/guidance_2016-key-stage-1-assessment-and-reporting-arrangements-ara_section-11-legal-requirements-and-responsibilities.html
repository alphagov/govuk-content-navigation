       <p>
        This statutory guidance contains provisions made pursuant to Article 9 of The Education (National Curriculum) (Key Stage 1 Assessment Arrangements) (England) Order 2004, as amended. This Order is made under section 87 of the Education Act 2002. This document gives full effect to, or otherwise supplements, the provisions made by the Order and as such has effect as if made by the Order. The Order can be viewed on the government’s

        11.2 Application of ARA to different types of school
       </h2>
       <p>
        This section details how the ARA applies to different types of school.

       <h3 id="maintained-schools">
        Maintained schools
       </h3>
       <p>
        The ARA applies to maintained schools, including maintained special schools, with pupils in
        <abbr title="key stage1">
         KS1
        </abbr>
        . There are different arrangements for maintained hospital schools (see below).

       <p>
        Maintained schools and
        <abbr title="local authorities">
         LAs
        </abbr>
        have a statutory duty to ensure that provision is made to meet the special educational needs of their pupils. Access arrangements guidance will be published on GOV.UK and will provide detailed information about the adjustments available so pupils can access the phonics screening check and the
        <abbr title="key stage1">
         KS1

       <h3 id="maintained-nursery-schools">
        Maintained nursery schools
       </h3>
       <p>
        Maintained nursery schools with pupils who will reach the age of 6 before the end of the school year must administer the phonics screening check.

       <h3 id="academies-and-free-schools-in-england">
        Academies and free schools in England
       </h3>
       <p>
        All references to academies include free schools, as in law they are academies. The following information also applies to
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alternative-provision">
         alternative provision (AP) academies
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        An academy’s funding agreement may say that they will follow guidance issued by the Secretary of State in relation to assessments of pupils’ performance. If so, they must comply with the ARA. The
        <abbr title="key stage1">
         KS1
        </abbr>
        assessment and reporting arrangements are only applicable if they provide education to pupils at this stage of learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        Academies are not required to follow the national curriculum. They need to teach a broad and balanced curriculum which, as a term of their funding agreement, includes English, mathematics and science. (For AP academies, this only includes English and mathematics.)
       </p>
       <p>
        The funding agreement means that they must comply with statutory assessments on the same basis as maintained schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        They must make provision to meet the special educational needs of their pupils, according to the requirements set out in their funding agreement.  Access arrangements guidance will be published on GOV.UK and will provide detailed information about the adjustments available so pupils can access the phonics screening check and the
        <abbr title="key stage1">

       <p>
        Academies should have arrangements for monitoring of the

        , although they are not required to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        Independent schools who want to participate in the tests will need to place a test order for the

         KS1
        </abbr>
        tests by Friday 27 November and must follow the arrangements in this ARA.
       </p>
       <p>
        Participating independent schools must confirm their intent to issue a privacy notice to the parents of pupils who are going to participate in any tests. They must gain approval from the parents of each participating pupil before the school places a test order on the
