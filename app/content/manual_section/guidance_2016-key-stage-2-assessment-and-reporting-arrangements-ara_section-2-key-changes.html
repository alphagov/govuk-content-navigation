       <p>
        The new national curriculum has been taught in all LA maintained primary schools, and some academies, in England since September 2014. Those pupils who are at the end of
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        in May 2016 will be the first to be assessed against the new national curriculum.

       <h2 id="new-tests">
        2.1 New tests
       </h2>
       <p>
        From 2016,
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        national curriculum test outcomes will no longer be reported using levels.
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/scaled-scores">
         Scaled scores
        </a>
        will be used instead.
       </p>
       <p>
        There will only be 1 set of tests for each subject. The tests will include a small number of questions designed to assess the most able pupils so separate tests, such as the previous level 6 tests, are no longer required.
       </p>
       <p>
        The mental mathematics test has been replaced with an arithmetic test.

        relating to the moderation of teacher assessment (TA) have now been published.
       </p>

        The deadline for submission of teacher assessment data is Thursday 30 June. LA moderation will take place from Monday 23 May.

       <h2 id="test-orders">
        2.4 Test orders
       </h2>
       <p>
        Maintained schools, academies and free schools do not need to place a test order for the standard versions of the
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        tests. Quantities of test materials will be sent to schools based on their autumn census data and pupil registration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Independent schools who want to participate in the tests will need to place a test order by Friday 27 November 2015.
       </p>
       <h2 id="modified-test-materials">
        2.5 Modified test materials
       </h2>
       <p>
        Schools can order modified versions of the tests, enlarged print, modified large print and braille, via the ‘Test orders’ section of the NCA tools website by Friday 27 November 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        For 2016, braille versions of the tests will be available in both Standard English Braille (SEB) and Unified English Braille (UEB).

       <p>
        Results from tests taken before 2016 will not be counted in the performance tables.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 2016, schools may consider entering pupils for some or all of the tests early. Where a pupil does not take all of the tests early, they may now take the other tests in future years.

       <h2 id="science-sampling-tests">
        2.7 Science sampling tests
       </h2>
       <p>
        The biennial science sampling tests will take place in June 2016. The tests will be administered in selected schools by external administrators. For those schools selected, participation is statutory.

       <h2 id="floor-standards">
        2.8 Floor standards
       </h2>
       <p>
        In 2016 schools will be held to account for the percentage of pupils achieving the expected standard at the end of
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        and whether they make sufficient progress based on a new, value-added measure of progress.
       </p>
       <p>
        A school will fall below the floor standard in 2016 where fewer than 65% of pupils achieve the expected standard and pupils do not make sufficient progress.
       </p>
       <h2 id="progress-measures">
        2.9 Progress measures
       </h2>
       <p>
        Progress measures in 2016 will work in a similar way to current primary value-added measures or Progress 8 in secondary schools. A school’s score will be calculated by comparing their pupils’
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        results against those of all pupils nationally who had similar starting points.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pupils will be assigned to prior attainment groups based on their
        <abbr title="key stage1">
         KS1
        </abbr>
        results.
       </p>
       <p>
        The department will confirm what score a school would need to get to have made ‘sufficient progress’ after the tests have been sat.
