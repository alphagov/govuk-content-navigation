        4.1 Overview of 2016 tests
       </h2>
       <p>
        For 2016, a new set of
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        national curriculum tests has been introduced consisting of:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         English reading: reading booklet and associated answer booklet
        </li>
        <li>
         English grammar, punctuation and spelling Paper 1: short answer questions
        </li>
        <li>
         English grammar, punctuation and spelling Paper 2: spelling
        </li>
        <li>
         mathematics Paper 1: arithmetic
        </li>
        <li>
         mathematics Paper 2: reasoning
        </li>
        <li>
         mathematics Paper 3: reasoning
        </li>
       </ul>

        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        English reading test
       </h3>
       <p>
        The English reading test will have a greater focus on fictional texts. There is also a greater emphasis on the comprehension elements of the new curriculum. The test consists of a reading booklet and a separate answer booklet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pupils will have a total of 1 hour to read the 3 texts in the reading booklet and complete the questions at their own pace. There will be a mixture of genres of text. The least-demanding text will come first with the following texts increasing in level of difficulty.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pupils can approach the test as they choose: eg working through one text and answering the questions before moving on to the next. The questions are worth a total of 50 marks.
       </p>
       <h3 id="ks2-english-grammar-punctuation-and-spelling-test">
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        English grammar, punctuation and spelling test
       </h3>
       <p>
        The new grammar, punctuation and spelling test has a greater focus on knowing and applying grammatical terminology with the full range of punctuation tested.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new national curriculum sets out clearly which technical terms in grammar are to be learnt by pupils and these are explicitly included in the test and detailed in the new test framework. It also defines precise spelling patterns and methodologies to be taught, and these are the basis of spellings in the test.
       </p>
       <p>
        There will be no contextual items in the test.
       </p>
       <p>
        As in previous years, there are two papers, Paper 1: questions and Paper 2: spelling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paper 1: questions consists of a single test paper. Pupils will have 45 minutes to complete the test, answering the questions in the test paper. The questions are worth 50 marks in total.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paper 2: Spelling consists of an answer booklet for pupils to complete and a test transcript to be read by the test administrator. Pupils will have approximately 15 minutes to complete the test, but it is not strictly timed, by writing the 20 missing words in the answer booklet. The questions are worth 20 marks in total.
       </p>
       <h4 id="ks2-mathematics-test">
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        mathematics test
       </h4>
       <p>
        There are 3 papers; Paper 1: arithmetic; Paper 2: reasoning; and Paper 3: reasoning.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paper 1: arithmetic replaces the mental mathematics test. The arithmetic test assesses basic mathematical calculations. The test consists of a single test paper. Pupils will have 30 minutes to complete the test, answering the questions in the test paper. The paper consists of 36 questions which are worth a total of 40 marks.
       </p>
       <p>
        The questions will cover straightforward addition and subtraction and more complex calculations with fractions worth 1 mark each, and long divisions and long multiplications worth 2 marks each.
       </p>
       <p>
        Papers 2 and 3 each consist of a single test paper. Pupils will have 40 minutes to complete each test, answering the questions in the test paper. Each paper will have questions worth a total of 35 marks.
       </p>
       <p>
        In some answer spaces, where pupils need to show their method, square grids are provided for the questions on the arithmetic paper and some of the questions on Paper 2.
       </p>
       <h2 id="scaled-scores">
        4.2 Scaled scores
       </h2>
       <p>
        Headteachers won’t need to change the way their school prepares for, or administers, the tests because of the introduction of scaled scores.
       </p>
       <p>
        Scaled scores help test results to be reported consistently from one year to the next. National curriculum tests are designed to be as similar as possible year on year, but slight differences in difficulty will occur between years. Scaled scores maintain their meaning over time so that two pupils achieving the same scaled score in different years will have demonstrated the same attainment.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        tests a scaled score of 100 will always represent the ‘expected standard’.
       </p>
       <p>
        A pupil’s scaled score will be based on their raw score. The raw score is the total number of marks a pupil receives in a test. The pupil’s raw score will be translated into a scaled score using a conversion table.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the 2016
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        tests STA will publish test results on the NCA tools website on 5 July 2016. Each pupil registered for the tests will receive:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         a raw score (the number of raw marks awarded)
        </li>
        <li>
         a scaled score
        </li>
        <li>
         and confirmation of whether or not they attained the expected standard
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Conversion tables for the 2016 tests will also be published on GOV.UK on 5 July so schools can understand how pupils’ scaled scores are derived from their raw scores.
       </p>
       <h2 id="sample-test-materials">
        4.3 2016 sample test materials
       </h2>
       <p>
        A full set of sample questions and materials has been published for the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum-assessments-2016-sample-materials">
         2016

          KS2

         national curriculum tests
        </a>
        to help teachers prepare for the 2016 tests.
       </p>
       <p>
        They have been designed to be as close as possible to the look and feel of the live tests. They can be used by schools as practice tests for pupils prior to the live tests. Modified versions of the sample tests will be published during the autumn term.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alongside the sample tests are mark schemes and test administration instructions.
       </p>
       <h2 id="test-frameworks">
        4.4 Test frameworks
       </h2>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum-assessments-test-frameworks">
         Test frameworks

        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        are available for each test. Although written primarily for test developers, these may also be of interest to schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        A description of a pupil performing at the expected standard is included in the test framework; it will be used to set the standard in relation to the test.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each framework sets out:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         what will and won’t be assessed in the test
        </li>
        <li>
         how each element of the subject will be assessed
        </li>
        <li>
         the structure of the tests
        </li>
        <li>
         a performance descriptor that describes the standard a pupil will be expected to achieve on the test in each subject
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The performance descriptor describes the range of knowledge and skills that a pupil working at the expected standard will be required to demonstrate in each key stage test, in each subject.
       </p>
       <p>
        The test frameworks don’t provide information on how schools should teach the new national curriculum. Teachers shouldn’t use the frameworks to guide their teaching and learning.
       </p>
       <h2 id="test-orders">
        4.5 Test orders
       </h2>
       <p>

        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        tests. Quantities of standard test materials will be sent to schools based on their autumn census and pupil registration data.
       </p>
       <p>
        Independent schools who want to participate in the tests will need to place a test order by Friday 27 November and complete pupil registration by Friday 18 March.
       </p>
