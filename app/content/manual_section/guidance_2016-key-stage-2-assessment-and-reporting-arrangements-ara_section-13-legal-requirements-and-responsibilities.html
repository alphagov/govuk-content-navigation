        This section details how the ARA applies to different types of school.

       <h3 id="maintained-schools">
        Maintained schools

       <p>
        The ARA applies to maintained schools, including maintained special schools, with pupils in
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        . There are different arrangements for maintained hospital schools (see below).
       </p>
       <p>
        Maintained schools and local authorities have a statutory duty to ensure that provision is made to meet the special educational needs of their pupils. The

        Academies and free schools in England

        All references to academies include free schools, as in law they are academies. The following information also applies to

       </p>
       <p>
        An academy’s funding agreement may say that they will follow guidance issued by the Secretary of State in relation to assessments and teacher assessments of pupils’ performance. If so, they must comply with the ARA. The
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        assessment and reporting arrangements are only applicable if they provide education to pupils at this stage of learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        Academies are not required to follow the national curriculum. They need to teach a broad and balanced curriculum which, as a term of their funding agreement, includes English, mathematics and science. (For AP  academies, this only includes English and mathematics.)
       </p>
       <p>
        The funding agreement means that they must comply with statutory assessments on the same basis as maintained schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        They must make provision to meet the special educational needs of their pupils, according to the requirements set out in their funding agreement. The

        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        , although they are not required to do so. Their results will not be reported in the performance tables.
       </p>
       <p>
        Independent schools who want to participate in the tests will need to place a test order for the
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        tests by Friday 27 November and must follow the arrangements in this ARA.
       </p>
       <p>
        Participating independent schools must confirm their intent to issue a privacy notice to the parents of pupils who are going to participate in any tests. They must gain approval from the parents of each participating pupil before the school places a test order on the

        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        tests. Their results should be reported by the school where the pupil is registered.

       <p>
        It is the responsibility of maintained schools and academies to register the pupils for the

        tests.

       <p>
        Pupils not on the register of a maintained school or academy that attend a PRU or hospital school are not required to take the tests. However, they are expected to receive a comparable education to a pupil in a mainstream school. Therefore it is recommended that
        <abbr title="key stage 2">
         KS2
        </abbr>
        assessments form part of their educational provision where appropriate.
