        7 Phonics screening check
       </h2>
       <p>
        The phonics screening check is designed to confirm whether pupils have learnt phonic decoding to an appropriate standard. It will identify pupils who need extra help to improve their decoding skills.
       </p>
       <p>
        The check consists of 20 real words and 20 pseudo-words that a pupil reads aloud to the teacher. Teachers can use the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phonics-screening-check-sample-materials-and-training-video">
         sample materials
        </a>
        to familiarise themselves with the check.
       </p>
       <p>
        Teachers can also look at
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/key-stage-2-tests-past-papers">
         materials from previous years

       </p>
       <h2 id="key-dates">
        7.1 Key dates
       </h2>
       <p>
        The check must be taken during the week commencing 13 June. A pupil may only take the check the following week if they were absent during check week.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a pupil doesn’t take the check during this period and returns to school after Friday 24 June they must be recorded as absent.

        7.2 Participation in the check
       </h2>
       <p>
        Participation in the check depends on the type of school. Which types of schools are required to participate in the check are detailed in section 11.
       </p>
       <h3 id="pupils-that-should-take-the-check">
        Pupils that should take the check
       </h3>
       <p>
        With some exceptions (see below), all pupils who have reached the end of year 1 must take the check. This includes pupils registered at maintained nursery schools who will reach the age of 6 before the end of the school year, the equivalent age to those pupils in year 1 at primary and infant schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless they fit the exceptions (below), pupils in year 2 must also take the check if they:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         didn’t meet the required standard in year 1
        </li>
        <li>
         haven’t taken it before
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Schools don’t need to register pupils for the check.

        Pupils that shouldn’t take the check
       </h3>
       <p>
        Pupils shouldn’t take the check if they:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         haven’t shown any understanding of grapheme-phoneme correspondences
        </li>
        <li>
         have recently moved to the country and are unable to understand letters and sounds in English
        </li>
        <li>
         use British sign language or other sign-supported communication, eg communication boards, to spell out individual letters
        </li>
        <li>
         are mute or selectively mute
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        If a pupil didn’t take the check in year 1 or year 2, or if they still did not meet the standard of the check in year 2, they don’t need to be considered for the check in future years. However, these pupils must continue to receive support in phonics.

       <h3 id="decisions-on-participation-in-the-check">
        Decisions on participation in the check
       </h3>
       <p>
        Headteachers should decide whether it is appropriate for each of their pupils to take the check or not. The headteacher’s decision regarding participation is final.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools should explain their decision to the pupil’s parents so that they understand why their child is or is not being assessed. If appropriate, they should provide the parents with documentary evidence to support their decision. Where the decision has been made not to administer the check to a child, schools should also explain how they are helping the child learn to decode using phonics.

       <h2 id="check-materials">
        7.3 Check materials
       </h2>
       <p>
        Schools don’t need to order standard materials for the check. Materials are sent to schools based on the year 1 autumn school census data.
       </p>
       <p>
        Braille materials must be ordered by Friday 6 May via our modified test helpline on 0300 303 3019. To comply with the Data Protection Act 1998, schools mustn’t request materials by email.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools will receive their check materials, including any braille orders, in the week commencing Monday 6 June.
       </p>
       <p>
        Materials are delivered to school addresses taken from the
        <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/edubase/faq.xhtml" rel="external">
         EduBase website

        7.4 Security of check materials
       </h2>
       <p>
        Headteachers are responsible for ensuring that the integrity of the check is maintained so that no pupil has an unfair advantage over another.
       </p>
       <p>
        Headteachers must keep their check materials secure  and treat them as confidential from the point the school receives them until Friday 24 June. Advice on keeping your check materials secure will be published during the assessment cycle.
       </p>
       <p>
        Check packs mustn’t be opened before Monday 13 June. They must only be opened when the check is going to be administered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Teachers mustn’t discuss the content of the check with anyone or use question-specific information to prepare pupils for the check. This helps to maintain the integrity of the check. In particular, teachers mustn’t discuss specific content which could compromise the check on social media or publish it in blogs.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the check has been administered, schools must make sure the materials are stored securely until Friday 24 June.
       </p>
       <p>
        A breach of the security of the check materials could lead to a maladministration investigation at the school.
