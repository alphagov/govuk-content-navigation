       <p>
        The moderation of
        <abbr title="early years foundation stage">
         EYFS
        </abbr>
        profile assessments begins within each individual setting. It is supported by
        <abbr title="local authorities">
         LAs
        </abbr>
        , or
        <abbr title="local authority">
         LA
        </abbr>
        approved agencies, through a programme of visits and meetings. Within their own settings, practitioners can agree assessment judgements with others informally. This might involve 2 practitioners, for example a teacher and a teaching assistant or a reception class teacher and a year 1 teacher, discussing evidence about a pupil’s development.

         LAs
        </abbr>
        have a statutory duty to make provision to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the assessments made by early years providers in their area. They must set up and carry out moderation arrangements to:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         secure the consistency and accuracy of judgements made by different practitioners
        </li>
        <li>
         reassure practitioners that their judgements are accurate, valid and consistent with national standards
        </li>
        <li>
         assure moderators that an acceptable level of accuracy and validity has been achieved for assessments  recorded and reported by the settings for which they have responsibility

       </ul>
       <p>
        Moderation of the
        <abbr title="early years foundation stage">
         EYFS
        </abbr>
        profile is a sampling process and not a method for checking each pupil’s attainment.
        <abbr title="local authority">
         LA
        </abbr>
        moderation visits use discussion to check teachers’ ability to make accurate assessments and apply them consistently. Evidence discussed includes:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         materials
        </li>
        <li>
         knowledge of the pupil
        </li>
        <li>
         anecdotal incidents
        </li>
        <li>
         results of observations
        </li>
        <li>
         information from additional sources that supports the overall picture of a pupil’s development
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Evidence doesn’t need to be formally recorded or documented. The extent to which the practitioner chooses to record information will depend on individual preference. Paperwork should be kept to the minimum that practitioners need to illustrate, support and recall their knowledge of the pupil’s attainment. The outcome of moderation should be recorded.

        must inform settings which are due to receive a visit by the end of the spring term. For moderation purposes, these settings will need to complete interim judgements against all early learning goals (ELGs) at the beginning of May for pupils in the final year of the
        <abbr title="early years foundation stage">
