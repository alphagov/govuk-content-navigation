       </h2>
       <p>
        Monitoring visitors, from either the
        <abbr title="local authority">
         LA
        </abbr>
        or STA, will make unannounced visits to schools administering the tests. 
They will check if the school is following the published
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/key-stage-2-tests-administer-the-tests">
         procedures
        </a>

        <li>
         administering the tests
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        If a school receives a monitoring visit they must allow visitors to:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         see all KS1 test materials and any relevant delivery notes
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
         see evidence to show that pupils using access arrangements, eg prompters, scribes or additional time, are doing so in accordance with normal classroom practice
        </li>
        <li>
         see copies of correspondence and other documents sent to and received from their
         <abbr title="local authority">

         or STA about the administration of the

         tests
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        STA will carry out a full investigation if a monitoring visitor reports:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         administrative irregularities
        </li>
        <li>
         potential maladministration
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        These investigations are used to make decisions on the accuracy or correctness of pupils’ results.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools should refer to the
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/key-stage-2-monitoring-visits-2014-guidance-for-local-authorities">
         guidance on monitoring visits

        7.1 Maladministration
       </h2>
       <p>
        The term ‘maladministration’ refers to any act that:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         affects the integrity, security or confidentiality of the national curriculum assessments
        </li>
        <li>
         could lead to results that don’t reflect pupils’ unaided work
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Schools could be subject to investigations of maladministration if they don’t comply with:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the ‘Assessment and reporting arrangements’
        </li>
        <li>
         STA’s
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/key-stage-2-tests-administer-the-tests">
          test administration guidance
         </a>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Schools should report any issue with the administration of the tests and/or any allegations of maladministration they receive by calling the national curriculum assessments helpline on 0300 303 3013.
       </p>
       <p>
        STA has a statutory duty to investigate any matter brought to its attention relating to the accuracy or correctness of any pupil’s results in the national curriculum tests.
       </p>
       <p>
        STA’s maladministration team works closely with
        <abbr title="local authorities">
         LAs
        </abbr>
        to investigate any allegations of maladministration. The
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/key-stage-1-and-2-maladministration-investigation-procedures">
         ‘Maladministration investigation procedures’
