     <p>
      The new standard published on 12 July 2016 sets out a clear description of
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standard-for-teachers-professional-development">
       effective practice in professional development for teachers
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The standard:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       helps teachers and providers of teacher training to understand aspects of good-quality professional development
      </li>
      <li>
       clarifies some common misconceptions
      </li>
      <li>
       complements the existing
       <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">
        teachers’ standards
       </a>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The standard is non-statutory. Schools will still be able to define their approach to professional development according to their own needs.
