      The Headteacher Reference Groups help the Department for Education (DfE) by influencing and improving policy development for primary and secondary education.
     </p>
     <p>
      The groups aim to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       act as a confidential sounding board for policy colleagues to test their policies, bringing practitioner voice and expertise into the department
      </li>
      <li>
       offer advice on long-term strategic policy development
      </li>
      <li>
       influence and impact on the rest of the system, especially through other school leaders, while retaining independence from the department
      </li>
      <li>
       act as a channel of communication between schools, the department and other agencies, including local authorities, to convey issues pertinent to school policies
      </li>
      <li>
       take into account and pass on the views of community partners, including primary schools and post-16 colleagues, business and industry partners
      </li>
      <li>
       inform and respond to the work of other relevant stakeholder groups and panels
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The groups are not representative and have no power of veto over policy decisions.
     </p>
     <h2 id="meeting-dates">
      Meeting dates
     </h2>
     <p>
      The groups meet 5 to 6 times per year, during term time.
