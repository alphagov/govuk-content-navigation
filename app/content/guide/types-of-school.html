    <p>
     All children in England between the ages of 5 and 16 are entitled to a free place at a state school.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most state schools have to follow the
     <a href="/national-curriculum">
      national curriculum
     </a>
     . The most common ones are:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      community schools, controlled by the local council and not influenced by business or religious groups
     </li>
     <li>
      foundation schools and voluntary schools, which have more freedom to change the way they do things than community schools
     </li>
     <li>
      academies, run by a governing body, independent from the local council - they can follow a different curriculum
     </li>
     <li>
      grammar schools, run by the council, a foundation body or a trust - they select all or most of their pupils based on academic ability and there is often an exam to get in
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="special-schools">
     Special schools
    </h2>
    <p>
     Special schools with pupils aged 11 and older can specialise in 1 of the 4 areas of
     <a href="/children-with-special-educational-needs">
      special educational needs
     </a>
     :
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      communication and interaction
     </li>
     <li>
      cognition and learning
     </li>
     <li>
      social, emotional and mental health
     </li>
     <li>
      sensory and physical needs
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Schools can further specialise within these categories to reflect the special needs they help with: Autistic spectrum disorders, visual impairment, or speech, language and communication needs (
     <abbr title="Speech, language and communication needs">
      SLCN
     </abbr>
     ) for example.
