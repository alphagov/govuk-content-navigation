      1. What corrections can be made
     </h1>
    </header>
    <p>
     You can apply for a birth registration correction when the information is wrong - for example if a mistake was made when recording a parent’s occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can’t apply for a correction to show new information if circumstances change after you’ve registered your child’s birth, for example if you change your name after getting married again.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, you can apply to re-register the birth if the natural parents get married at a later date.
    </p>
    <h2 id="where-to-apply">
     Where to apply
    </h2>
    <p>
     In England and Wales you can apply for a correction to either:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       the register office where your child’s birth was registered - for minor mistakes in a parent’s occupation, birthplace or address
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       the General Register Office (
       <abbr title="General Register Office">
        GRO
       </abbr>
       ) - for mistakes involving things like names
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      There’s a different process for correcting registrations made in

     Removing the wrong father’s details
    </h2>
    <p>
     You can only apply to change who the father is if a DNA test proves (or a court order says) that the man named on the certificate isn’t the natural father.
    </p>
    <p>
     You must apply to the
     <abbr title="General Register Office">
      GRO
     </abbr>
     for this type of change.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-happens-if-you-change-gender">
     What happens if you change gender
    </h2>
    <p>
     If you
     <a href="/apply-gender-recognition-certificate/changing-your-gender">
      get your gender change approved
     </a>
     , you’ll get a new short birth certificate with your new gender on it. It’s free.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-the-correction-looks-like">
     What the correction looks like
    </h2>
    <p>
     If your application is approved, a correction is made in the register in the office for the area where your child was born.
    </p>
    <p>
     The original information will always be shown in the register. After the correction has been authorised, a note will be added to the margin of the register. This will explain what the correct information is and when the correction was made.
    </p>
    <p>
     All full birth certificates that are issued after the correction will include the note in the margin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Short birth certificates only include the child’s details and won’t have a note in the margin - they just show any correct new details.
