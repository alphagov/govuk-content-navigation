    <p>
     If your child is taken into care because of a care order, your council will share responsibility for making
     <a href="/parental-rights-responsibilities/what-is-parental-responsibility">
      most of the important decisions
     </a>
     about your child’s upbringing, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      who looks after them
     </li>
     <li>
      where they live
     </li>
     <li>
      how they are educated
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     If you agree to your child becoming ‘looked after’ and there is no care order, you’ll continue to have parental responsibility for your child.
    </p>
    <p>
     In either case, the council is responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      making sure that an appropriate standard of care is provided
     </li>
     <li>
      making sure only suitable people are employed to look after your child
     </li>
     <li>
      providing proper training and support to staff and foster carers
     </li>
     <li>
      listening to your child’s views and your views about care arrangements and taking their religion, race, culture and background into account
     </li>
     <li>
      making sure your child has someone independent to talk to and knows how to complain if necessary
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The child may be placed with either:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      another relative
     </li>
     <li>
      a foster carer
     </li>
     <li>
      a children’s home
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="care-orders">
     Care orders
    </h2>
    <p>
     A care order is given by a court. It allows a council to take a child into care. Under the
     <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/part/IV" rel="external">
      Children Act 1989
     </a>
     a council can apply for a care order if it believes a child is suffering or at risk of suffering significant harm.
    </p>
    <p>
     The court decides if the child can be taken into care.
    </p>
    <p>
     Care orders last until:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      the child’s 18th birthday
     </li>
     <li>
      an order is made giving parental responsibility to another person - eg through adoption or special guardianship
     </li>
     <li>
      the court lifts the order (this is called ‘discharging’ the order)
     </li>
    </ul>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      A child can only be taken into care if they are under 18.
