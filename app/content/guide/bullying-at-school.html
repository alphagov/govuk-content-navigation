     Schools and the law
    </h2>
    <p>
     By law, all state (not private) schools must have a behaviour policy in place that includes measures to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
     This policy is decided by the school. All teachers, pupils and parents must be told what it is.
    </p>
    <h3 id="anti-discrimination-law">
     Anti-discrimination law
    </h3>
    <p>
     Schools must also follow
     <a href="/discrimination-your-rights">
      anti-discrimination law
     </a>
     . This means staff must act to prevent discrimination, harassment and victimisation within the school. This applies to all schools in England and Wales, and most schools in Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
     Northern Ireland has
     <a href="http://www.equalityni.org/sections/default.asp?secid=2" rel="external">
      different anti-discrimination law.
