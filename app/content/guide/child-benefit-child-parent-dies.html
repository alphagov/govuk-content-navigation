     You’ll usually get Child Benefit for 8 weeks after the child dies. If they would have had their 20th birthday before the 8 weeks are up, Child Benefit will stop on the following Monday.

     You’ll need to tell the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible if a child you’re getting Child Benefit for dies.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can do this either:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <a href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/forms/form/child-benefit-child-change-of-circumstances/new" rel="external">

      - you’ll need to set up a Government Gateway account if you don’t have one

     <li>
      <a href="/contact/hm-revenue-customs/child-benefit">
       by phone or by post
      </a>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     You must include the date of death.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Child Benefit Office will let other parts of HM Revenue and Customs (
     <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">
      HMRC
     </abbr>
     ) know, so you only have to get in touch with
     <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">
      HMRC
     </abbr>
     once.

     If the child died before you sent a claim form, you can still send one (unless the child was stillborn).

     How to claim
    </h3>
    <ol class="steps">
     <li>
      <p>
       Make a
       <a href="/child-benefit/how-to-claim">
        claim for Child Benefit
       </a>
       .
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Attach a note with the date of the child’s death.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Put your contact details and National Insurance number on the note.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Send the child’s birth or adoption certificate with your claim form (you don’t have to send their death certificate).
      </p>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     If you don’t have the child’s birth or adoption certificate, you can
     <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate">
      order a new one
     </a>
     and send it in later.
    </p>
    <p>
     If your child died before the end of the week they were born in, the 8 weeks will start from the Monday following the death.
    </p>
    <p>
     Child Benefit can only be backdated for up to 3 months. The longer you leave your claim, the less you’ll get.
