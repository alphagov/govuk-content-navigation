    <h2 id="school-behaviour-policy">
     School behaviour policy
    </h2>
    <p>
     Every school has a behaviour policy, which lists the rules of conduct for pupils before and after school as well as during the school day.
    </p>
    <p>
     The policy should also say what the school does to prevent bullying.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can ask the school for a copy of the policy document.
    </p>
    <h2 id="punishments">
     Punishments
    </h2>
    <p>
     Schools can punish pupils if they behave badly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Examples of punishments (sometimes called ‘sanctions’) include:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      a telling-off
     </li>
     <li>
      a letter home
     </li>
     <li>
      removal from a class or group
     </li>
     <li>
      confiscating something inappropriate for school , eg mobile phone or MP3 player
     </li>
     <li>
      detention
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="detention">
     Detention
    </h3>
    <p>
     Schools don’t have to give parents notice of after-school detentions or tell them why a detention has been given.
    </p>
    <h3 id="physical-contact">
     Physical contact
    </h3>
    <p>
     School staff can use reasonable force to control and restrain pupils. This could include leading a pupil by the arm into a classroom.
    </p>
    <h3 id="complaining-about-a-punishment">
     Complaining about a punishment
    </h3>
    <p>
     If you disagree with the way your child’s been punished, first talk to the headteacher. If you’re not satisfied, ask for a copy of the complaints procedure.
