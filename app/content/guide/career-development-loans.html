     Professional and Career Development Loans are bank loans to pay for courses and training that help with your career or help get you into work.
    </p>
    <p>
     You may be able to borrow between £300 and £10,000.
    </p>
    <p>
     Loans are usually offered at a reduced interest rate and the government pays interest while you’re studying.
