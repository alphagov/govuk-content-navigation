     Your partner isn’t in the UK and you don’t have children

     You may get
     <a href="/working-tax-credit">

     as a single person if you’ve come to the UK, are working and your partner has stayed behind in their own country.
    </p>
    <p>
     You’ll need to let the Tax Credit Office know within a month if your partner joins you in the UK. This is because your tax credits payments may change.

     You may also be able to get
     <a href="/child-tax-credit">

     if you have a child and:
    </p>
    <ul>

     You usually can’t claim for a child who lives outside the

     You’ll need to let the

     If you’ve got children and your partner gets benefits paid by another

     country or Switzerland, this may affect your tax credits.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some benefits are counted as income, eg benefits paid because of unemployment. Others, like family benefits, aren’t.
