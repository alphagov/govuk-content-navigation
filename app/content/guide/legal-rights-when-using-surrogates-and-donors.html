     If you use a surrogate they will be the legal mother of any child they carry.

     Mother’s rights
    </h2>
    <p>
     The woman who gives birth is always treated as the mother in UK law and has the right to keep the child - even if they’re not genetically related. However, parenthood can be transferred by
     <a href="/legal-rights-when-using-surrogates-and-donors/becoming-the-childs-legal-parent">
      parental order or adoption
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Surrogacy contracts aren’t enforced by UK law, even if you’ve a signed deal with your surrogate and have paid for her expenses.
    </p>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      It’s illegal to pay a surrogate in the UK, except for their reasonable expenses.

     The child’s legal father or ‘second parent’ will be the surrogate’s husband or partner unless:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      legal rights are given to someone else through a
      <a href="/become-a-childs-legal-parent">

      or
      <a href="/child-adoption/overview">
       adoption
      </a>
     </li>
     <li>
      the surrogate’s husband or civil partner didn’t give their permission to their wife or partner
     </li>
    </ul>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
     <p>
      If your surrogate has no partner, or they’re unmarried and not in a civil partnership, the child will have no legal father or second parent unless the partner actively consents.
