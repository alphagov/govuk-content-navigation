    <p>
     All births in England, Wales and Northern Ireland must be registered within 42 days of the child being born.
    </p>
    <p>
     You should do this at the
     <a href="/register-offices">
      local register office
     </a>
     for the area where the baby was born or at the hospital before the mother leaves. The hospital will tell you if you can register the birth there.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you can’t register the birth in the area where the baby was born, you can go to another register office and they will send your details to the correct office.
    </p>

     When registering the birth, you should know:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      place and date of the birth
     </li>
     <li>
      name, surname and sex of the baby

    <h2 id="what-you-should-take">
     What you should take
    </h2>

     You should take at least one form of identification when you go to the register office. You can use:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      passport
     </li>
     <li>
      birth certificate
     </li>
     <li>
      deed poll
     </li>
     <li>
      driving licence
     </li>
     <li>
      proof of address (eg utility bill)
     </li>
     <li>
      Council Tax bill
     </li>
     <li>
      marriage or civil partnership certificate
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     You should also take your child’s personal child health record or ‘red book’ as some registrars may ask to see it.
    </p>
    <div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">

      If you’re going to the register office on your own, you may need

       proof of paternity
      </a>
      from the other parent before you give their details.

     Organisations you need to contact

    <p>
     Having a child may affect your tax and benefits and services from your local council. The Tell Us Once service can report a birth to several government organisations in one go. The registrar will let you know if this service is available in your area.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bring the following information to your Tell Us Once appointment:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      the date of birth, address, phone and National Insurance number of the people to be named on the birth register, or of any partner living in the same household
     </li>
     <li>
      details of benefits anyone to be named on the birth register is getting or has applied for
     </li>
     <li>
      details of benefits any partner living in the same household is getting or has applied for
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     If the Tell Us Once service isn’t available in your area, you’ll need to:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      claim
      <a href="/child-tax-credit/overview">
       Child Tax Credit
      </a>
     </li>
     <li>
      contact
      <a href="/contact-jobcentre-plus">
       JobCentre Plus
      </a>
      about your benefits
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="child-benefit">
     Child Benefit
    </h3>
    <p>
     You can’t apply for
     <a href="/child-benefit">
      Child Benefit
     </a>
     through the Tell Us Once service but you may be able to have your claim verified at your appointment. This means that you won’t have to buy a second birth certificate to send off with your claim form.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ask your local registrar if you can do this when you make your Tell Us Once appointment.
