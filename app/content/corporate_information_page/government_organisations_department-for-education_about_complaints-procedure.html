         When we receive a complaint, we immediately refer it to an appropriate staff member who will then carry out an investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will reply in writing, or by telephone, within 15 working days from when we receive your complaint. If it is not possible for us to fully respond to you within this time, we will let you know and tell you what we are doing to deal with your complaint, when you can expect the full reply and from whom.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will always acknowledge where things could have been done better and tell you what we will do to avoid the same thing happening again. Equally, if we don’t agree with your complaint, we will let you know why.
