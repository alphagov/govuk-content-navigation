         NCTL's aims are to improve academic standards by recruiting and developing a workforce to meet the needs of our school system, and to help schools to help each other to improve. 

We will work towards developing a 0 to 18 education system which will allow new ways of working to support the best schools, headteachers, and teachers to lead improvements in the quality and training of all school staff.

         We are responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul>

        <p>
         Our priorities for 2016 to 2017 are to:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          support schools to take control of their own recruitment and training of teachers, through School Direct, and support the development of new school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) provision while encouraging higher education providers to work in partnership with schools further to improve their programmes of training
         </li>
         <li>
          provide the framework and scaffolding to reform the national professional qualifications (NPQs) while continuing to quality assure the awarding of these qualifications
         </li>
         <li>
          oversee the induction process for teachers and award qualified teacher status and early years teacher status
         </li>
         <li>
          uphold high standards of teacher professional conduct
         </li>
         <li>
          encourage schools to develop their own networks of high-quality school-to-school support
         </li>
         <li>
          enable schools to broker support from the best school leaders and teachers through teaching school alliances, the Teaching Schools Council, national leaders of education, national support schools and regional schools commissioners
