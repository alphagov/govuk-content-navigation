         Release of key stage 2 results: July 2016
        </h4>
        <p>
         The 2016 key stage 2 assessments are the first which assess the new, more challenging national curriculum which sets high expectations for each child. New tests and frameworks for teacher assessment have been introduced to reflect the new curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
         Levels have been removed and each pupil will now be given a scaled score outcome. In July 2015 we published guidance on scaled scores which made clear we won’t set the standards on the new tests until pupils have taken them and tests have been marked.
        </p>
        <p>
         In previous years, headteachers and parents always had last year’s results to benchmark their performance against in advance of the national statistics publication in late August.
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to help headteachers and parents set the results in context, I was asked to consider whether results could be published any earlier to provide more context to this year’s results.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have decided to publish the following figures at national level on 5 July 2016:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          the percentage of pupils in England achieving the expected standard in reading, writing and mathematics
         </li>
         <li>
          the percentage of pupils in England achieving the expected standard in reading
         </li>
         <li>
          the percentage of pupils in England achieving the expected standard in writing
         </li>
         <li>
          the percentage of pupils in England achieving the expected standard in mathematics
         </li>
         <li>
          the percentage of pupils in England achieving the expected standard in grammar, punctuation and spelling
         </li>
         <li>
          average scaled score in reading
         </li>
         <li>
          average scaled score in mathematics
         </li>
         <li>
          average scaled score in grammar, punctuation and spelling
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         I will confirm the exact time of release closer to the time.
