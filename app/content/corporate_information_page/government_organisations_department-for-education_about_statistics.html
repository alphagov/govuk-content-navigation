         16 February 2017: Statistics update from the Head of Profession for Statistics at DfE
        </h3>
        <p>
         This note sets out forthcoming work planned by the statistics teams in DfE. The work is in response to the opportunities created from the creation of
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/longitudinal-education-outcomes-study-how-we-use-and-share-data">
          Longitudinal education outcomes dataset
         </a>
         , the machinery of government changes bringing further and higher education statistics into the same department as school-level statistics. There are also some specific actions following UK Statistics Authority (
         <abbr title="UK statistics authority">
          UKSA
         </abbr>
         ) assessment of statistics on schools pupils and their characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
         The key areas are:
        </p>
        <p>
         1) Updating our statistical policies and procedures covering release practices, revisions policy, corrections policy and statement of administrative sources. These are to ensure that they are up-to-date and consistent across all areas of DfE and cover points in the
         <abbr title="UK statistics authority">
          UKSA
         </abbr>
         assessment. I will also look at the data request and access procedures. This is to ensure they are consistent across DfE following the machinery of government changes.
        </p>
        <p>
         2) In order to assess the potential unmet demands of users, we plan to utilise the customer insight function to engage with existing and potentially new users to test what we might improve.
        </p>
        <p>
         3) As Head of Profession, I will lead a piece of work to explore how we can better release statistics in a way which better gives overviews of the key areas the department publishes data on. This will look at brigading publications together to present coherent overviews of areas of interest. Users currently have to look across many publications to get an overview of what is happening in the children’s care sector, primary schools, etc. Is there a way we could make the information more accessible, quicker and give a more coherent overview? This will also consider whether the opportunities from the Longitudinal education outcomes dataset have been fully exploited in our statistics yet.
        </p>
        <p>
         4) On unlawfully large class sizes, we will be testing the new guidance with a sample of suppliers as promised. We already have a review of our procedures underway which we have committed to report on.
        </p>
        <p>
         5) We will expand our existing quality assurance document on performance tables to cover all school statistics.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will provide an update on these actions in April. If users would like to put forward any views, please do not hesitate to contact me at
