         One of our current priorities is to increase the proportion of apprentices from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds by 20% by 2020.

This toolkit provides information to engage and inspire communities and employers to make apprenticeships more diverse.

         Equality data and projects
        </h3>
        <p>
         We produce annual data on participation and achievement rates (formerly known as success rates) of apprentices and adult learners by ethnicity, gender, learning difficulties and/or disabilities and age. The FE sector can use this data to implement strategies to address gaps at organisational level.
        </p>
        <p>
         Between 2009 and 2015 we funded a vast array of small equality and diversity projects to help support the FE sector to advance equality. In the early years all the projects were about innovation. More recently we supported projects that could share and sustain good practice across the sector. Materials and resources produced are published and free to access and use.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have commissioned research on a variety of topics in recent years.
