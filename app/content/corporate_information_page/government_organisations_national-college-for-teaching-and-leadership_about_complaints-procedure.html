         You may report serious professional misconduct of a teacher to the National College for Teaching and Leadership, but only after all possible local procedures have been followed, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          contacting the school’s headteacher and/or chair of governors
         </li>
         <li>
          contacting the local authority, where they are the teacher’s employer
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Use our
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-misconduct-referral-form">
          teacher misconduct referral form
         </a>
         and include as much relevant information and evidence as possible, as well as details of the local procedures that have already taken place to deal with the allegation.
        </p>
        <p>
         NCTL will confirm whether a referral will lead to an investigation and a hearing, as set out in our disciplinary procedures.
