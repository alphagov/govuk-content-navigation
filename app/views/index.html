          <dl class="changes">
            <dt>Removed the sections "Most popular' and 'Latest'</dt>
            <dd>None of the users noticed them without prompting. 'Latest' feels more needed because education users need always to know the latest information to do their job. 'Most popular' feels like a redundant category because users cannot tell who it is for</dd>

            <dt>Added navigation of higher levels of the education taxonomy</dt>
            <dd>We want to see how users move across levels of the taxonomy</dd>

            <dt>Broke down the long list in Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 and each of those by subjects</dt>
            <dd>Users found it frustrating to use and hard to find content they were after</dd>

            <dt>Added descriptions under each taxon and under each piece of content</dt>
            <dd>In the taxon case, we want to give an example of the breadth of content each topic contains. In the descriptions case, we want to have an explanation of unclear titles </dd>

            <dt>Focused on 'Guidance' content and removed 'Research &amp; Analysis'</dt>
            <dd>We've focussed on guidance to begin with because it's the most viewed content type and the one we know most about</dd>

            <dt>Removed 'Published by'</dt>
            <dd>Users donâ€™t feel the need to know at a navigation page level, but prefer to know the department who published the piece of content at a document level</dd>
